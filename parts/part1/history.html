<h3>Brief History</h3>

<p>On <strong>April 7, 2014</strong>, the University President, Fr. Joel T. Tabora, S.J., through the Academic Vice President, Fr. Gabriel Jose T. Gonzales, S.J., wrote Hon. Sec. Bro. Armin A. Luistro, F.S.C., Secretary of the Department of Education, the Ateneo de Davao University's interest to offer the academic strand of the Senior High School Program in the school year 2016-2017.</p>

<p>On <strong>March 31, 2015</strong>, the Bureau of Secondary Education through the Senior High School – National Task Force Chair Jocelyn Dr. Andaya, Director, approved the application of the Ateneo de Davao University to offer the Senior High School Program in the school year 2016-2017 [Permit No. 349183].</p>

<p>In the <strong>summer of 2015</strong>, a series of meetings for the Grade 11 curriculum for the Senior High School academic strand commenced. Mr. Ricardo P. Enriquez chaired these meetings identified the core and applied subjects of the three strands: <strong>STEM, ABM, and HUMSS</strong> which required the writing and/or compiling of modules or daily lesson guides using the <strong>Ignatian Pedagogical Paradigm</strong> teaching-learning formation; he recommended the appointment of several higher education faculty to be the module writers/ compilers to Fr. Joel E. Tabora, S.J. who approved the said recommendations; and the appointed professors started work on their assigned subject area.</p>

<p>On <strong>August 26, 2015</strong>, Mr. Ricardo P. Enriquez wrote the Secretary of the Department of Education of the Ateneo Senior High School's intention to offer <strong>Footwear Design and Manufacturing</strong> under the Senior High School-Technology Vocational and Livelihood Program.</p>

<p>On <strong>April 1, 2016</strong>, eleven higher education faculty were laterally transferred to the Ateneo Senior High: three to serve as administrators [Assistant Director for Academics, Registrar, and Liberal Arts Chair] and nine as teachers of Filipino, Physical Education, and Chemistry.</p>

<p>On <strong>April 4, 2016</strong>, using the one-stop registration and enrollment procedure at F213, Finster Building, the enrollment for Grade 11 of the Senior High School began. Plans for constructing the Ateneo Senior High School building that will house Grades 11 and 12, with projected total learners for both grade levels to reach 4,000, are on the drawing board.</p>

<p>For the <strong>school year 2016-2017</strong>, however, the Ateneo Senior High initiated its operation for Grade 11 with <strong>2,000 learners, 78 teachers, 16 administrators, and 15 non-teaching personnel</strong> at the Finster Building [2F-7F] and a couple of rooms in the Canisius Building.</p>

<p>In <strong>2018</strong>, AdDU SHS made a significant leap by transferring to its permanent <strong>Bangkal, Davao City campus</strong>. The relocation reflected the University's investment in providing SHS learners a more conducive learning environment. This campus embodies the <strong>Ignatian values of discernment, simplicity, and service</strong> while also creating space for young minds' creative, scientific, and humanistic pursuits.</p>

<p>With the outbreak of the <strong>COVID-19 pandemic in 2020</strong>, the SHS unit swiftly pivoted to <strong>online learning</strong>, embodying the University's core value of resiliency in the face of adversity. It adopted the <strong>Hurtado Courseware</strong>, a learning management system developed by the University, ensuring that Ignatian education would continue despite the limitations of lockdowns and health protocols. Faculty were trained in remote instruction and digital pedagogy, while learners were supported through virtual counseling, spiritual formation, and flexible learning strategies.</p>

<p>In <strong>2023</strong>, a new chapter began with the installation of <strong>Fr. Karel S. San Juan, S.J.</strong>, as the new University President. Fr. San Juan brought a renewed emphasis on Ignatian leadership, inclusive education, and mission-driven innovation, reinforcing the school's direction toward forming learners who are <strong>leaders-in-service</strong>, especially in Mindanao and the marginalized sectors.</p>

<p>In <strong>2024</strong>, the University appointed <strong>Dr. Gina L. Montalan</strong> as <strong>Vice President for Basic Education</strong>, further aligning the strategic directions of Basic Education with the University's mission to provide quality and holistic Jesuit education from early childhood to adolescence.</p>

<p>In <strong>2025</strong>, <strong>Dr. Joan Grace A. Palconit</strong> was installed as <strong>Principal of the Senior High School</strong>, becoming a key leader in shaping the unit's next phase. Under her leadership, AdDU SHS continues to strengthen its formation programs, faculty development, academic innovation, and student support services—ensuring that every graduate is prepared for college or career and life-long commitment to <strong>justice, sustainability, peace, and human dignity</strong>.</p>

<p>From its foundation to the present, the Ateneo de Davao Senior High School remains steadfast in its mission: to form young men and women of Mindanao who are intellectually competent, morally rooted, spiritually discerning, and socially responsible—faithful stewards of the Jesuit tradition and active participants in building a more just, humane, and hopeful society.</p>
