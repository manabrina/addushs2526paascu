    The University has established a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1napknsoHeDUfO2I3jk0cWFVEy9tC35YzQRKBN2ugJRg/edit?tab=t.0" target="_blank">University Community Engagement and Advocacy Council (UCEAC)</a> responsible for articulating and overseeing its advocacy and engagement initiatives. These initiatives are incorporated into the operations of the Senior High School through the Arrupe Office for Social Formation. The details of these plans are outlined in the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TSJnnmUo5SInzGTMQN-sT2xnhq9XnpEs/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">One Ateneo One Plan (1A1P) Strategic Plan for 2018–2023</a>.
    <br><br>Additionally, the Senior High School has developed its own comprehensive <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EUhFhCMbuRlLdeY5FtWtWLxPy4mW9m7B/edit" target="_blank">SHS Plan for Networks, Linkages, and Partnerships (2025-2030)</a> that complements the university’s overall strategies and is anchored on the UCEAC Guidelines. This plan provides a systematic approach to developing relationships at multiple levels in pursuance of the school's goals in the Mindanao context. The plan begins with maintaining a broad network of contacts with local government units and non-governmental organizations to share information and identify opportunities. From this network, the school establishes formal linkages for specific academic purposes, such as the integration of community engagement into the curriculum of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pm5MXjkMT_JXTk0EVheTkTk7mX3XgZr3HOA7m7uwlF8/edit?tab=t.0" target="_blank">Catholic Social Teaching (CST)</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gFERM5zK0mIC8RufMII8_uqPrBI6-rE5cw4FFdb3nVQ/edit?tab=t.0" target="_blank">Leadership Development Program (LDP)</a>. For deeper, long-term collaboration, these relationships are solidified into formal partnerships with selected communities to work on sustained projects. This strategic plan, implemented by the Arrupe Office, ensures the SHS intentionally builds a robust ecosystem of relationships to enrich student formation.

    The University adheres to the guidelines and protocols for community engagement and advocacy established by the University Community Engagement and Advocacy Council (UCEAC) to build networks, linkages, and partnerships with various agencies and groups. In the Senior High School, the Arrupe Office for Social Formation serves as the primary implementing unit for all community engagement initiatives. The specific mechanisms and protocols followed by the Arrupe Office are formally documented in its <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JN8KTXDdNdeAqArPt5cmT9jjlEoCzlCA/edit" target="_blank">Arrupe Office for Social Formation - Manual of Operations.</a>. This manual details the systematic process for engagement, from formalizing partnerships to coordinating with the Academic Cluster for curricular integration, ensuring that the university-level strategic direction from UCEAC is effectively translated into concrete, mission-aligned actions at the Senior High School level.

    All linkages and partnerships at Ateneo de Davao Senior High School are supported by appropriate agreements, with the review and approval process governed by the university's official <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/18368uo_yRXs_wa-uMzpGnCeyZVr6msXQ/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">Guidelines and Procedures in initiating and managing partnership agreement</a>. This document establishes a clear and systematic procedure to ensure all agreements are properly vetted and authorized. As mandated by these guidelines, the process begins when a proposing office, such as the Arrupe Office, submits a Letter of Intent and a draft agreement. This draft then undergoes a formal, multi-level review sequence, requiring clearance from the Legal Counsel, the Vice President for Finance (if applicable), and the Executive Vice President before it is presented for the University President's signature. This established system, which is detailed in the guidelines, ensures every <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14lH71GUhflmfeikmbDo7ENX7LmI0ZN61?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) or other partnership contract</a> is legally sound, financially viable, and fully aligned with the university's mission before being notarized and implemented.

    The evaluation of all network, linkage, and partnership activities is conducted annually to consistently ensure their alignment with the school's vision, mission, and goals. The Arrupe Office for Social Formation spearheads this process using a multi-method approach. This includes <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AkiWeu4ZZsY_sf5p7NbaRj9rhkbr-RJs/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">formal evaluation meetings</a> with community leaders to discuss partnership outcomes and the collection of <a href="#" target="_blank">evaluations from SHS faculty</a> to assess formational impact. In addition to these, the office gathers comprehensive feedback using the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xJuGD7FTh8y17ZXjKtVmhcinZO7vIhRC/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">official Partnership Evaluation Form</a>, which is administered to student participants, faculty moderators, and representatives from the partner agencies. The form assesses the partnership's impact on student formation, its success in meeting community objectives, and its overall contribution to the school's mission. All data is then consolidated into an <a href="#" target="_blank">Annual Partnership Evaluation Report</a>, which is submitted to the Assistant Principal for Formation for review and strategic planning.
