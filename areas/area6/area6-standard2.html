  <p>
    The Arrupe Office for Social Formation implements community engagement and service activities for various members of the school and partner communities. It appropriates its activities for three sectors: academic, formation, and teachers’ community engagement.
    <br><br>At the academic level, all Grade 12 students are required to participate in community engagements integrated with the subjects <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12YLUqTYEYlY05X8OnhX0dz-aTqtbvJvP/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">Leadership Development Program</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ei2VSxHekwaN6NGzNwFMAleSX3krEUWr/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">Catholic Social Teachings</a>. At the formation level, student clubs are encouraged to initiate <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=833201482152649&set=pb.100063884149916.-2207520000" target="_blank">outreach projects</a> that foster social awareness, responsibility, and solidarity. Meanwhile, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LmQGZOgwDN192PypvRcsM7Qgz9NVqQEp/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">teachers participate in community service activities</a> that align their professional expertise and personal skills with the identified needs and priorities of partner communities.
    <br><br>Through this process, students and teachers develop leadership, empathy, and social responsibility, while partner communities <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=965002162434198&set=pcb.965003209100760" target="_blank">benefit from concrete assistance</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1082167683922693&set=pb.100063884149916.-2207520000" target="_blank">capacity-building</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1055329373278525&set=pcb.1055332906611505" target="_blank">sustained partnerships</a>. In this way, community engagement promotes mutual growth enriching the learning and formation of the school community while fostering empowerment and development in the communities served.

  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3.8</p>
  <p>
    The school promotes multi-sectoral involvement in its community engagement programs. The Arrupe Office for Social Formation ensures that students, faculty, administrators, and community stakeholders contribute meaningfully based on their roles and expertise.
    <br><br>The activities are intentionally designed as a dynamic platform for both the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pJgrFFBY0jx_o3dvci5RPXxOUSYGGjRr/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=104453165653003521610&rtpof=true&sd=true" target="_blank">utilization and development of competencies</a> across all participating sectors. For students, the program utilizes their existing communication skills in roles like facilitating and documenting, while actively developing higher-order competencies in leadership, empathy, and social analysis. For faculty and administrators, it utilizes their pedagogical expertise as they mentor students, while simultaneously utilizing their skills aligned with their professional experience and expertise.
    <br><br>Crucially, the program utilizes the invaluable indigenous knowledge of our community partners as local experts, and in the process, develops their own competencies in co-program management and youth mentorship.

  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4</p>
  <p>
    Community engagement is fully integrated into the academic curriculum through formation-focused subjects.
    <br><br>Guided by the Church’s Pastoral Cycle, the Arrupe Office developed the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1klrWzpTGoTcpAbpIK_IbuzyMrvSsTFNP/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=104453165653003521610&rtpof=true&sd=true" target="_blank">Pakighinabi – Pamalandong – Adbokasiya framework</a>, which processes students’ community engagement and service activities from experience to reflection and eventually to concrete action. This tool is integrated into the academic programs.
    <br><br>The <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cik_T4SFfJ5v0U5zlIZ1Jf3XUc0I4GTb/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">Catholic Social Teachings (CST)</a> subject provides the theological and ethical foundation by using the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tQMCd3UF7pL67MYvQsqzer8zpI0nsR51/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">Pastoral Cycle (experience–reflection–action)</a> to allow students to analyze social issues more deeply, understand the realities faced by partner communities, and explore possible responses. Patterned after this is the Pakighinabi–Pamalandong–Adbokasiya that guides students from encounter to reflection to concrete action for the common good. The Leadership Development Program 3 and 4 strengthens this by giving students opportunities to design and implement advocacy initiatives, such as creating income-generating activities that support both their learning and the needs of the community. After each engagement, students immediately process their experiences through reflection activities and evaluations, ensuring that learning is both personal and meaningful.
    <br><br>This integration ensures that community engagement is not treated as an extracurricular activity but as a core pedagogical tool, allowing students to connect classroom learning with lived realities, fostering both intellectual formation and a strong sense of social responsibility, while contributing to the empowerment of partner communities.
