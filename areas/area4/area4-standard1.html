    The Curriculum Alignment Framework guarantees that the Senior High School curriculum remains appropriate and firmly anchored on the school’s Philosophy, Vision, Mission, and Goals (PVMG), advancing holistic formation through integrating the Characteristics of Jesuit Education (CJE). Anchored on the principles of backward instructional design and the three stages of the logical framework: designing, monitoring, and evaluating, the Framework ensures coherence, intentionality, and alignment of all offerings with the school’s PVMG. In 2019, the University Vice President for Academics reinforced the One Ateneo, One Plan (1A1P) PVMG by embedding the school’s Excellence Standards alongside the Department of Education (DepEd) minimum requirements, thereby unifying institutional priorities with national standards.
    <br><br>The alignment of academic programs is operationalized through subject guides that articulate learning competencies alongside formation outcomes across all disciplines. In response to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, the curriculum was revitalized in 2020 through Online Instruction Delivery Plans (OIDPs), later refined in 2021 into Flexible Instruction Delivery Plans (FIDPs) as restrictions eased. These resources continue to be revisited and enhanced using the same framework, ensuring adaptability to emerging learning contexts while remaining faithful to institutional formation outcomes.
    <br><br>The school upholds its Excellence Standards by deliberately integrating co-curricular formation into the curriculum, consistent with the Assistant Principal for Formation’s Formation Articulation that formation is an essential dimension of Jesuit education. Structured into four pillars, talent, social, spiritual, and leadership development, formation programs are designed as co-curricular pillars that work in tandem with academic learning. Evidence of this integration is documented in the Formation Articulation of the APA-Formation, which outlines how faith, social responsibility, leadership, cultural identity, and *cura personalis* are systematically nurtured in student life.
    <br><br>The Curriculum Alignment Framework ensures that the Senior High School curriculum is government-accredited, as evidenced by the regular renewal of the school’s Permit to Operate from DepEd, which requires compliance with strand structures, subject offerings, and competencies outlined in the K to 12 Curriculum Guides and MELCs (DepEd Order No. 21, s. 2019), as well as adherence to assessment standards under DepEd Orders No. 8 and 41, s. 2015. Since 2016, AdDU-SHS has consistently complied with these standards, securing authority to operate the ABM, HUMSS, and STEM strands, each enriched with vision-mission-driven subjects such as Theology and the Leadership Development Program. The STEM strand is further distinguished by its three specialized sub-areas: Pre-Computer Studies, Pre-Engineering and Architecture, and Pre-Science, which offer unique courses like Technical Drawing, Program Logic, and Multimedia Technologies. Recognized by DepEd as a pilot implementer of the Strengthened Senior High School (SSHS) Curriculum for Grade 11 beginning AY 2025–2026, the school demonstrates that its Permit to Operate is not merely regulatory compliance but confirmation that its curriculum is nationally aligned, mission-driven, and rooted in the Jesuit commitment to forming *sui generis* leaders for Mindanao and beyond.

    The school has in place well-defined policies, guidelines, and processes for the design, review, and periodic updating of the curriculum, ensuring alignment with the Department of Education standards and the university’s Philosophy, Vision, Mission, and Goals (PVMG).
    <br><br>These institutional guidelines, through the curriculum alignment framework, provide clear directions on how curriculum development must be undertaken across all academic strands and are disseminated and operationalized by the Academic Office in collaboration with Cluster Leaders and faculty members.
    <br><br>Curriculum design is anchored on the K-12 Curriculum as mandated by the DepEd while remaining faithful to the Curriculum Alignment Framework of the university. The Curriculum Alignment Framework organizes instructional planning around four essential questions: Why teach?, What to teach?, How to teach?, and how to assess?. This framework ensures that the intended, implemented, and achieved curriculum remains aligned.
    <br><br>Curriculum review follows a structured process. At the classroom level, teachers use the Weekly Educator’s Journal (WEJ) to narrate how learning plans were implemented, while also recommending improvements to lessons and activities. At the cluster level, year-end cluster reviews evaluate alignment of subject implementation with intended learning outcomes as evidenced by the minutes of the meeting. On top of this, curriculum review workshops, such as the one held in February 2024, are convened more frequently when required by DepEd or University reforms. These workshops systematically examine subject vertical articulation, teaching-learning strategies, and assessment mechanisms.
    <br><br>Curriculum updating is also proactive. In 2025, the curriculum was revisited with the pilot implementation of the Strengthened Senior High School (SSHS). The curriculum was reviewed prior to AY 2025–2026 to ensure readiness. Internal cluster reviews supplement the workshops, with each cluster submitting new subject guides and FIDPs prior to the start of each academic year, consolidated by the Assistant Principal for Academics.

  <p>
    Stakeholder participation is embedded in the Curriculum Alignment Framework. Administrators, led by the Assistant Principal for Academics, provide direction, while teachers contribute subject expertise in shaping learning outcomes, scope, and sequence. The curriculum was contextualized to offer ABM, HUMSS, and STEM strands, with STEM further divided into Pre-Engineering and Architecture, Pre-Computer Studies, and Pre-Science, all enriched by vision-driven subjects such as Theology and the Leadership Development Program.
    <br><br>Development and monitoring are collaborative. Teachers prepare Subject Guides and Learning Plans with outcomes, strategies, and assessments, which are peer-reviewed in Cluster Growth Sessions. Implementation is tracked through the Weekly Educator’s Journal (WEJ), consolidated by clusters, and monitored by the Assistant Principal for Academics. Learner input is included through the evaluation tool, the Grade 12 Batch 2025 Curriculum Review Survey, which provided direct feedback on curricular effectiveness.
    <br><br>Findings from WEJs and surveys inform the updating stage. The APA convenes annual subject enhancement sessions where Cluster Leaders assign revisions to Learning Plans and instructional materials. Recent updates, such as preparations for the SSHS pilot implementation and adjustments to the MATATAG Curriculum, show that administrators and teachers work together to ensure the curriculum remains responsive, aligned, and mission-driven.

  <h3 class="criterion" id="criterion-4">Criterion 4. Learning and performance outcomes in the different subject areas are clearly defined both within the subject area (vertical articulation) and across subject areas (horizontal articulation) in the grade level.</h3>
  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.0</p>
  <p>
    Vertical articulation of learning outcomes is ensured by aligning competencies with the DepEd K to 12 framework, where skills are developed in Grade School, deepened in Junior High, and enhanced in Senior High School, preparing learners for the four curriculum exits: college, employment, entrepreneurship, and middle-level skills. This progression was institutionalized through the Vertical Articulation Workshop in March 2023, which identified gaps, designed recovery strategies, and integrated technopreneurship, followed by the February 2024 workshop that mapped competencies across GS, JHS, and SHS in preparation for the MATATAG curriculum. Subject Guides show this progression, such as algebraic skills in Mathematics advancing to Calculus and Statistics, and scientific methods in Chemistry applied to Practical Research.
    <br><br>Within Senior High, vertical articulation is evident in strand-based reinforcement, where core competencies are extended in applied and specialized subjects. For example, in STEM, mathematical and research competencies are scaffolded across core, applied, and specialized subjects, while in ABM, business math and communication skills are reinforced in subjects like Applied Economics and Business Ethics, and in HUMSS, critical reading and writing are extended through Practical Research and Philippine Politics and Governance. This ensures that learning outcomes are not duplicated but systematically advanced.
    <br><br>Horizontal articulation is achieved through Performance Task (PT) collaborations, institutionalized by the Assistant Principal for Academics. Each year, cluster leaders present culminating tasks in a gallery walk, after which interested clusters agree on complementary collaborations. These are formalized into a unified GRASPS model written into each Subject Guide. This institutionalized practice fosters integration of skills and concepts across subjects, promoting authentic and interdisciplinary learning.

  <p>
    The school has established a coherent system of curriculum alignment and instructional planning to ensure that all programs remain consistent and align with the DepEd standards, the University’s PVMG, and strand-specific learning outcomes. This system is guided by the Curriculum Alignment Framework, which provides the basis for ensuring that subject competencies are vertically and horizontally aligned, clearly articulated, and implemented effectively across grade levels and strands.
    <br><br>Each Subject Guide articulates the Scope and Sequence, unpacking the DepEd competencies whilst integrating the PVMG to ensure a logical progression of learning from foundational knowledge to higher-order thinking skills. These guides are reviewed as the need arises, particularly in response to emerging learner needs or during the school’s annual preparation before the start of the academic year. Revisions are then undertaken to align with DepEd updates, institutional reforms, and contextual demands, thereby ensuring that the curriculum remains articulated, responsive, and relevant.
    <br><br>Instructional plans are communicated systematically through a standardized Flexible Instruction Delivery Plan (FIDP) and the Subject Guide. The Subject Guide clearly articulates the subject learning outcomes, formation outcomes, scope and sequence, and assessment strategies, thereby serving as a comprehensive reference for both teachers and learners. These guides are formally presented and communicated to students during the Ateneo Senior High Orientation Program (ASHOP) and are likewise made accessible in the subject’s courseware, ensuring that learning expectations and assessment standards are transparent from the beginning of the academic year.
    <br><br>To ensure fidelity of implementation, cluster growth sessions are conducted for each subject, providing teachers with opportunities to deepen content mastery and align classroom activities with the intended learning outcomes. Each cluster also submits its Learning Plans on a regular basis, while teachers complete the Weekly Educator’s Journals (WEJ). The WEJ documents classroom practices, formative assessment strategies, learner responses, and recommendations for improvement. These entries are consolidated and submitted to the Office of the Assistant Principal for Academics (APA), where they serve as the basis for collective reflection, identification of challenges, and formulation of enhancements to teaching practices.

  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.0</p>
  <p>
    The curriculum is continuously enriched through research initiatives that directly inform program improvement and policy development. The study *AdDU-SHS Teachers' Perspectives of Online Teaching Pedagogy during COVID-19* emphasized the need for teacher upskilling in digital platforms (courseware) and led to the adoption of Quality Independent Learning Time (QuILT) in the class schedule and the SHS Unified Monitoring Sheet (SUM) for tracking learner progress, particularly in identifying Learners Needing Intervention (LNIs). The research on *Teachers’ Research Attitudes and Capabilities* resulted in the crafting of guidelines in faculty-led research to strengthen the integration of research into curriculum design.
    <br><br>The study *Demystifying the Utilization of AI-Powered Tools in the Post-Pandemic Educative Process* identified both opportunities and challenges in AI integration, serving as the baseline for the guidelines on AI use in senior high school. Likewise, the research on *Teachers’ Readiness in Addressing Learners’ Mental Health Concerns and Issues* led to the Wellness and Testing Center’s targeted trainings for faculty and administrators, reinforcing holistic formation. More recently, through the initiative of the Registrar’s Office, the school adopted the online learner report card, enabling students and parents to conveniently access academic performance without the need to visit campus physically.
    <br><br>The integration of technology in the academic programs through adherence to the online certification standards in the preparation of the subject courseware allowed for a more relevant teaching and learning process. The features of the senior high school’s Moodle platform are utilized (<a href="https://hurtado20.addu.edu.ph/" target="_blank">https://hurtado20.addu.edu.ph/</a>).
    <br><br>Collectively, these studies innovations demonstrate how the school sustains a strong culture of research and innovation, ensuring that its curriculum and programs remain adaptive, ethical, and mission-aligned.

  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.0</p>
  <p>
    The school has concrete practices and processes that serve as mechanisms for periodic curriculum review and refinement. Through the Weekly Educators’ Journal (WEJ), teachers document their classroom practices, assessment strategies, and learner responses. Each subject area then collates and summarizes the WEJs, making the insights more accessible and actionable during the Learning Plan and Instructional Plan enhancement sessions held before the start of the next academic year.
    <br><br>In addition, prior to the end of each academic year, clusters conduct year-end meetings where teachers share their experiences, challenges, and recommendations for improvement. These meetings, documented through the Minutes of the Meeting, provide valuable inputs that inform curricular adjustments. Furthermore, in the last academic year, the Office of the Assistant Principal for Academics (APA) implemented a curriculum evaluation for the graduating class, allowing the school to assess program effectiveness from the learner’s perspective and to identify areas requiring further enhancement.
    <br><br>Taken together, these practices demonstrate that although a comprehensive system is still evolving, the school already engages in regular and reflective processes of curriculum monitoring and evaluation. Moving forward, the school is committed to consolidating these existing practices into a documented framework for curriculum management, ensuring that the process becomes systematic, sustainable, and fully aligned with DepEd standards, institutional goals, and stakeholder needs.
