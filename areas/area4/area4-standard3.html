    The Ateneo de Davao University – Senior High School follows a comprehensive <a href="#" target="_blank">Admission Procedure</a> that includes an interview with both learners and their parents. This process captures each learner’s personal and academic profile, which is recorded in the Strand Chairperson’s Office. Parents’ narratives provide valuable insights into the learners’ needs, enabling the school to offer appropriate support. Moreover, at the start of classes, a diagnostic test is administered to identify learners’ strengths and weaknesses across subjects, serving as a basis for teachers in preparing lesson plans. Also, the learners take a placement test to determine their academic skills that fit their chosen strand. Throughout the semester, learner progress is monitored using the <a href="#" target="_blank">SHS Unified Monitoring Sheet</a> and the <a href="#" target="_blank">Guidelines in Feedbacking</a> (Levels 1–4), ensuring parents and guardians are informed of academic performance. <a href="#" target="_blank">Conferences and deliberations</a> led by class advisers and strand chairpersons are conducted to plan targeted programs and interventions for learners who require support. Learners who do not meet the minimum standard undergo a deliberation with the Assistant Principal for Academics and Strand Chairpersons to determine appropriate remediation classes. Before the end of the school year, Grade 11 strand chairpersons endorse student records to their Grade 12 counterparts prior to enrollment. Academic administrators continue to monitor learners’ progress until graduation. In the context of graduating learners, the <a href="#" target="_blank">Graduation, Honors, and Awards Committee</a> conducts a deliberation for the awards and honors, and learners who will be endorsed for graduation. All procedures are detailed in the <a href="#" target="_blank">Operations Manual on Tracking Learner Progress</a>.

    The school ensures that learning plans are strictly aligned with the curriculum guide provided by the Department of Education. Teachers unpack the curriculum guide, and the outputs will be used in preparing the <a href="#" target="_blank">Learning Plan</a> accordingly, while cluster leaders review them to ensure validity and alignment to the <a href="#" target="_blank">University Alignment Framework</a>, with the intended learning outcomes on the formative and summative assessments. The clusters discuss the weaknesses and strengths of the developed or enhanced learning plan, particularly on assessment methods, as reflected in the <a href="#" target="_blank">Minutes of the Meeting</a>.
    <br><br>Moreover, the strategies, activities, and assessments are selected and applied appropriately. Teachers are encouraged to employ varied assessment practices that cater to the learners’ needs and preferences, ensuring that tools such as rubrics and checklists are crafted with fairness and reliability. After implementation, teachers document their evaluations and reflections in the <a href="#" target="_blank">Weekly Educator’s Journal</a> and in <a href="#" target="_blank">Cluster Meetings</a>, which serve as a basis for enhancing future learning plans.
    <br><br>In preparing the assessments, all teachers adhere to the <a href="#" target="_blank">Exam Preparation Guidelines</a>. Every cluster prepares a <a href="#" target="_blank">Table of Specifications</a> for any form of assessment, like quizzes or tests, to ensure the validity.

    The school ensures that the learning outcomes are achieved through validation and evaluates the quality or effectiveness of the learning outcomes through evaluation, as stated in the <a href="#" target="_blank">Learning Plan</a>. The results or scores of the students on the assessments are used to identify the students who successfully achieved the target learning outcomes. This is performed through classroom feedbacking for the information and guidance of the learners. However, if the learners fail to meet the minimum standard, they will be given remediation, like homework.
    <br><br>Reports on results of assessments (% of learners who passed and did not pass) are discussed during <a href="#" target="_blank">Cluster Meetings</a>. Moreover, the narrative of the teacher on the test results in the <a href="#" target="_blank">Weekly Educator’s Journal</a> is also used in reflecting on whether the learning outcomes are successfully met by the learners.

    The school regularly reviews its methods of assessing student learning, including the tools, strategies, and instruments used as reflected in the <a href="#" target="_blank">Learning Plan</a> during the <a href="#" target="_blank">Annual Curriculum</a> Enhancement. On one hand, assessment strategies, such as formative and summative assessments, performance tasks, examinations, and peer evaluations, are evaluated after their classroom implementation by the teachers. These are discussed in the <a href="#" target="_blank">Growth Sessions</a>. Similarly, tools such as rubrics and checklists, and instruments such as task sheet formats and other templates, undergo thorough review in clusters. Moreover, the review and evaluation are reflected in the <a href="#" target="_blank">Weekly Educators Journal</a> and eventually discussed during the cluster meetings (<a href="#" target="_blank">Minutes of the Meeting</a>).
    <br><br>On the other hand, learners are involved in reviewing the tools implemented and used in their classes through the <a href="#" target="_blank">Monthly Evaluation Survey</a>. Based on the findings, teachers discuss the results in their respective clusters to address their concerns and make some necessary enhancements, including revising rubrics, checklists, and test items to improve the assessment process.

    The school conducts exit interviews with graduating students through the offices of the Academics and the Formation.
    <br><br>The <a href="#" target="_blank">Curriculum Review Questionnaire</a> is used to gather insights on their overall experience, as well as the strengths and gaps of the programs and subjects offered by the school. These insights are used to enhance the learners’ experiences of the co-curricular and extra-curricular activities and programs for the curriculum, along with instructional and assessment strategies. The exit interview is administered through a Google Form survey to capture graduates’ insights, experiences, and reflections on the curriculum and programs.
    <br><br>On the formation programs, especially in the Wellness and Testing Center, an interview through the <a href="#" target="_blank">Exit Form</a> is conducted with graduating students to gather feedback about their academic journey, school services, and personal development. The interview includes questions on students’ overall school experience, challenges they faced, support services they experienced, future plans like employment, further studies, and suggestions for improvement. The data helps the school assess the effectiveness of its guidance, counseling, and wellness programs and identify areas for improvement in student support services.
