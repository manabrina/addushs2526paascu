  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.0</p>
  <p>
    The process of selecting, developing, implementing, and evaluating teaching modalities, methods, and learning activities is grounded on the <a href="#" target="_blank">Alignment Framework</a> and the <a href="#" target="_blank">Ignatian Pedagogical Paradigm (IPP)</a>, the adopted teaching model at Ateneo de Davao University. This framework ensures that the teaching of a subject aligns with its intended purpose, as defined by the Department of Education in the "goal of the subject," represented as the <a href="#" target="_blank">minimum standards</a>. Additionally, it aligns with the subject's role in achieving the Vision, Mission, and Goals (VMG) of the university, which articulate the <a href="#" target="_blank">excellence standards</a>.
    <br><br>The <a href="#" target="_blank">Alignment Framework</a> provides the structural guide by ensuring coherence among the four essential questions: Why teach? How to assess and evaluate? How to teach? What to teach? This means that before teaching strategies and modalities are decided, the goals of teaching the subject, its nature, and its contribution to the mission of the university are first established. Once these are clear, appropriate assessment mechanisms are identified, ensuring that the evaluation truly measures whether outcomes are being achieved. Teaching methods and strategies are then selected to best deliver the intended learning outcomes, while the scope and sequence of topics are refined to ensure alignment. This process ensures that teaching is not fragmented but rather systematically planned, implemented, and evaluated within a coherent framework.
    <br><br>Minimum standards, which represent the required competencies set by the Department of Education, are articulated in the <a href="#" target="_blank">Curriculum Guides</a>. These are subsequently unpacked into subject learning outcomes and topic learning outcomes, which directly inform the <a href="#" target="_blank">Online Instruction Delivery Plan (OIDP)</a>. From the OIDP, the program adapts into the <a href="#" target="_blank">Flexible Instruction Delivery Program (FIDP)</a>, allowing teachers to adjust teaching modalities and methods in response to the changing needs of students and contexts. This cascading ensures that while regulatory requirements are met, the institution’s commitment to excellence, rooted in its PVMG, is also realized in daily classroom instruction.
    <br><br>The appropriation of the <a href="#" target="_blank">Ignatian Pedagogical Paradigm (IPP)</a> components into student learning activities provides the reflective and formative dimension of the teaching-learning process. The <a href="#" target="_blank">Learning Plan</a> reflects IPP’s core elements, context, experience, reflection, action, and evaluation, which guide teachers to design learning activities that go beyond the transmission of knowledge.
    <br><br>The role of teachers and cluster leaders is central to the whole process. Teachers are the primary implementers, tasked with translating the Alignment Framework into concrete lesson plans, instructional strategies, and learning activities. They are responsible for ensuring that classroom practices remain faithful to both minimum and excellence standards. Cluster leaders, on the other hand, provide academic leadership and guidance. They facilitate collaborative planning among teachers, monitor implementation through <a href="#" target="_blank">classroom observations</a>, and ensure that the curriculum and instruction are consistent with the Alignment Framework and the IPP by reviewing the Learning Plan.
    <br><br>Part of the evaluation of the Learning Plan is the teacher’s completion of the <a href="#" target="_blank">Weekly Educator’s Journal</a>. This document captures the implementation of the Learning Plan, the most effective strategies, suggestions for improvement of the LP, and reflection of the teacher. This information is used for the enhancement of Learning Plans focused on selecting, developing, implementing, and evaluating the teaching modalities, methods, and learning activities. Discussions on these are done, as evidenced in the <a href="#" target="_blank">Minutes of Weekly Cluster Meetings</a>.

  <p></p>
  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.5</p>
  <p>
    The school faithfully adopts the <a href="#" target="_blank">Ignatian Pedagogical Paradigm (IPP)</a> as the cornerstone of its teaching approaches, embodying the <a href="#" target="_blank">Jesuit educational</a> philosophy that emphasizes holistic formation, intellectual rigor, and service-oriented learning. Jesuit education is characterized by the integral formation of the whole person—mind, heart, and spirit. This is integrated into the <a href="#" target="_blank">Learning Plan</a> to ensure that learning is both academically rigorous and values-driven. Learning activities are structured to develop cognitive, socio-emotional, and moral competencies, consistent with the school’s mission and vision.
    <br><br>The Ignatian Pedagogical Paradigm (IPP) serves as the concrete framework where this philosophy is operationalized in the teaching-learning process. The five core elements of IPP: context, experience, reflection, action, and evaluation, are embedded in all <a href="#" target="_blank">learning plans</a> and seamlessly integrated into <a href="#" target="_blank">Hurtado20</a>, the school’s official Learning Management System (LMS). This ensures that learning activities, assessments, and instructional materials are not only aligned with course outcomes but also intentionally designed to form students in the Ignatian tradition. Learning activities are also explicitly grounded in the Senior High School’s <a href="#" target="_blank">6 C’s</a>. Every lesson, classroom activity, and assessment is structured to cultivate these six dimensions of formation.
    <br><br>Through the alignment of teaching modalities with the Ignatian tradition, Ateneo de Davao University-Senior High School ensures that education remains both academically excellent and deeply transformative, preparing students not only for higher studies and professional careers but also for meaningful lives dedicated to service, justice, and the greater glory of God.

  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.0</p>
  <p>
    Stakeholder feedback is an essential part of refining teaching modalities, strategies, and learning activities. Student feedback is systematically gathered through several mechanisms. PULSO, the official student body organization, captures more frequent feedback on students’ learning experiences through <a href="#" target="_blank">Monthly Evaluation Survey</a>. Additionally, the <a href="#" target="_blank">Teacher’s Evaluation by Learners</a> provides structured insights into instructional delivery, clarity of content, and engagement strategies. Teachers, on the other hand, contribute insights through the <a href="#" target="_blank">Weekly Educator’s Journal</a>. These allow teachers to make timely adjustments to lesson strategies to improve instructional effectiveness.
    <br><br>Parents are also engaged in the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. Feedback is gathered through <a href="#" target="_blank">anecdotal from parents</a> during Convergence (card-giving days), where comments about student progress and learning experiences are shared. Furthermore, when specific concerns arise, parents are invited for a dialogue with the Strand Chairperson wherein formal communication of observations and suggestions are recorded in a <a href="#" target="_blank">conference form</a>. These insights from parents help the school evaluate whether the chosen teaching modalities are effective not only academically but also in supporting students’ well-being and holistic formation.

  <h3 class="criterion" id="criterion-4">Criterion 4. The teaching modalities, strategies, and learning activities are adopted to promote learning outcomes and life-long learning.</h3>
  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.5</p>
  <p>
    The teaching modalities, strategies, and learning activities are adopted to promote learning outcomes and lifelong learning. This is achieved through careful preparation of <a href="#" target="_blank">learning plans</a> in which every subject’s learning outcomes are anchored on both the minimum standards and excellence standards that both respond to the development of the lifelong learning skills among students following the <a href="#" target="_blank">Alignment Framework</a>.
    <br><br>The Alignment Framework provides the structural basis for embedding lifelong learning into teaching and learning. Learning plans contain topic learning outcomes that are cascaded from the Department of Education’s prescribed minimum standards together with the institution’s excellence standards. DepEd has already articulated lifelong learning in its K to 12 Curriculum through the <a href="#" target="_blank">learning competencies</a>, which emphasize critical thinking, problem-solving, collaboration, and values integration. At Ateneo de Davao University-Senior High School, these DepEd standards are further elevated by the university’s own vision-mission goals, thereby aligning <a href="#" target="_blank">subject learning outcomes</a> not only with academic achievement but also with excellence standards rooted in Ignatian values.
    <br><br>Lifelong learning is the ongoing, self-motivated pursuit of knowledge, skills, and values for personal development, employability, social responsibility, and active citizenship. It recognizes that learning is not confined to formal schooling but is a continuous process that extends throughout life. In the Senior High School context, this means forming students who are not only competent in subject content but also prepared to adapt, grow, and contribute meaningfully to society in diverse and changing contexts. This is evident in the <a href="#" target="_blank">formation outcomes</a> that are included in the <a href="#" target="_blank">subject guide</a> per subject.
    <br><br>The school particularly champions the development of <a href="#" target="_blank">six sub-skills</a> that are essential for lifelong learning: critical thinking, communication, collaboration, creativity, character formation, and citizenship. These champion skills are integrated across the curriculum, ensuring that learning activities do not only develop cognitive knowledge but also nurture socio-emotional and moral capacities.

  <h3 class="criterion" id="criterion-5">Criterion 5. There is regular monitoring and evaluation of the teaching modalities, strategies, and learning activities for improvement.</h3>
  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.2</p>
  <p>
    The school implements a consistent system for monitoring and evaluating teaching modalities, strategies, and learning activities to ensure alignment with learning outcomes and continuous improvement.
    <br><br>This monitoring is carried out through multiple channels that capture feedback from different perspectives. Teachers regularly accomplish the <a href="#" target="_blank">Weekly Educator’s Journal</a>, where they reflect on classroom experiences, identify challenges, and document learner responses to strategies employed. These journals are reviewed by cluster leaders to detect trends, address concerns, and recommend adjustments. Learners, on the other hand, provide their perspective through the semestral <a href="#" target="_blank">Teacher’s Evaluation by Students</a>, which gathers structured feedback on instructional clarity, relevance of strategies, and the quality of classroom engagement. This student voice ensures that evaluations are learner-centered and grounded in actual classroom experience.
    <br><br>To complement self-reflection and student feedback, <a href="#" target="_blank">semestral classroom</a> observations are conducted by cluster leaders, following a three-pronged approach: pop-in, formative, and summative observations. The pop-in visit provides an unannounced snapshot of daily teaching practices, the formative observation gives constructive feedback for professional growth, and the summative evaluation serves as a comprehensive review of teaching effectiveness at the end of the term. These observations ensure that feedback is holistic—capturing both the spontaneity of daily practice and the planned execution of learning activities.
    <br><br>What makes the process effective is how the feedback loop is operationalized. After data is collected from journals and observations, cluster leaders synthesize the results and meet with teachers for a post-conference to discuss strengths, areas for improvement, and possible strategies for refinement. Adjustments are then integrated into subsequent lesson planning and instructional delivery. This cycle of feedback, reflection, and action ensures that monitoring is not merely evaluative but formative, driving continuous improvement in teaching modalities and strategies for the benefit of student learning.
