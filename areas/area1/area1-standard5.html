  <h3 class="criterion">Criterion 1. A risk management system is in place to identify, assess, and communicate to the school community the risks associated with unfortunate events.</h3>
  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4</p>
  <!-- Start Explanation -->
  <p>
    The school demonstrates a systematic approach to risk governance through its Risk Management Committee, which oversees the identification, assessment, and mitigation of risks as stipulated in the Operational Plan. This framework ensures safety and operational continuity by integrating mechanisms such as the PPO’s QR-Code Scanning System for physical hazards, clinic-led medical services, and emergency protocols for health concerns, and student-focused interventions through unified monitoring systems, pre-recorded lecture videos and materials, and parent collaboration. Human resource risks are addressed through training and wellness programs, while data privacy is protected through updated verification processes and secure systems. Moreover, there are measures that strengthen financial and environmental stability: proper budgeting, accurate liquidation, cost-efficient practices, and school-promotion caravans, to sustain financial capability and accountability, while compliance with mandated potability tests and environmental standards reinforces commitment to ecological responsibility. Collectively, these initiatives illustrate the institution’s proactive leadership in embedding a culture of preparedness, resilience, and accountability across its operations.

  <h3 class="criterion">Criterion 2. The risk management system includes provisions for the effective management of resources to mitigate the impact of unfortunate events and maximize opportunities for sustainability.</h3>
  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4</p>
  <!-- Start Explanation -->
  <p>
    The school administrators oversee resources aimed at minimizing negative events through careful distribution, financial planning, and continuous evaluation to ensure readiness and sustainability in various risk domains. Budget allocation reports are the basis for preventative measures and immediate interventions such as fire safety instruction and security upgrades. Several initiatives to mitigate the impact of unfortunate events are implemented through emergency drills and protocols, evacuation route signage, account verification, and other security measures. To promote sustainability, the university incorporates initiatives that focus on water conservation, energy efficiency, waste management (Ecoteneo), and mental health support (COPERS, WTC, HR), all of which necessitate ongoing funding and skilled staff. Regular assessments conducted by designated departments ensure that resource utilization corresponds with prioritized risks, while policies facilitate continual training, updates to protocols, and the preservation of institutional knowledge.

  <h3 class="criterion">Criterion 3. Risk management policies and protocols are formulated, documented, and disseminated to the entire school community and other stakeholders.</h3>
  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5</p>
  <!-- Start Explanation -->
  <p>
    The school formulates policies and procedures through a collaborative approach that includes essential administrative departments, specialized offices, and stakeholder representatives to ensure alignment with the university’s mission, legal requirements, and operational necessities. The Risk Management Committee pinpoints areas of risk, assesses current government regulations and internal policies, and creates control measures specific to risks in environmental, financial, security, and academic domains. Once drafted, policies are reviewed and sanctioned by governance entities or pertinent committees to maintain institutional accountability.
    <br><br>Following approval, the policies are officially documented in guidelines and standard operating procedures to ensure consistent implementation references. These documents are subject to regular revisions to adapt to new risks, regulatory updates, or changing organizational priorities. The school distributes policy information extensively through memoranda, training sessions, workshops, digital platforms, and signage, with designated offices such as Human Resource Management, Risk Management, and Safety and Security responsible for overseeing distribution and compliance.

  <h3 class="criterion">Criterion 4. The administrative team involves the school community and other stakeholders in the implementation of the risk management system while assuming the primary responsibility for managing risks.</h3>
  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5</p>
  <!-- Start Explanation -->
  <p>
    The Risk Management Committee engages the entire school community in implementing the system by ensuring that policies and measures are co-developed with faculty, staff, students, and parents. Consultations, assemblies, and surveys are used to gather insights on risks and to design context-specific responses. Implementation is further strengthened by involving stakeholders in hands-on activities such as safety drills, simulation exercises, and monitoring initiatives. Student councils, faculty representatives, and parent associations actively assist in promoting compliance and awareness within their respective groups. Partnerships with external stakeholders, including local government and emergency agencies, ensure that responses are aligned with broader community systems. This collaboration transforms risk management into a collective responsibility supported by both internal and external partners.
    <br><br>By embedding participation in every stage, the committee ensures that risk management remains inclusive, transparent, and responsive to the evolving needs of the school.

  <h3 class="criterion">Criterion 5. The school’s resources are safeguarded and effectively utilized to mitigate the impact of unfortunate events.</h3>
  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5</p>
  <!-- Start Explanation -->
  <p>
    The school protects its resources through clear policies, close monitoring, and transparent accountability systems. The Risk Management Committee, together with faculty, staff, students, and parents, identifies where resources should be allocated through internal scanning. Regular consultations ensure that funds and materials are directed to urgent and preventive needs. Resources are also used strategically to strengthen the school’s readiness for emergencies. Safety equipment, health supplies, IT systems, and facilities are maintained and made available for immediate use when needed. Faculty, staff, and student leaders help monitor these resources to ensure they remain effective and accessible. In this way, resources are not only safeguarded but also maximized for the benefit of the whole community.
    <br><br>Evaluation and accountability are built into the system to keep resource management effective. Regular audits and committee reviews, with input from stakeholders, confirm that resources are properly used and gaps are addressed quickly. Feedback from the community guides adjustments in allocation to meet emerging needs. This ensures that the school’s resources remain reliable safeguards in reducing the impact of unfortunate events.
