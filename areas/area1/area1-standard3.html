  <h3 class="criterion">Criterion 8. A system for the periodic evaluation of plans, programs, and activities is in place, and adjustments to the strategic goals and the execution of these are made as needed.</h3>
  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.5</p>
  <!-- Start Explanation -->
  <p>
    Ateneo de Davao University Senior High School (SHS) maintains a systematic and participatory framework for the periodic evaluation of plans, programs, and activities, ensuring continuous alignment with strategic goals. The process is anchored in a common evaluation cycle that includes year-end evaluations, complemented by year-end consolidated submissions.
    <br><br>Evaluation begins at the student level through learning portfolios, performance logs, and formative feedback, which are consolidated at the cluster level to assess academic achievement, program effectiveness, and extracurricular engagement. At the unit level, Heads of Office evaluate their respective functions and report results to the Principal, who forwards them to the administration. These evaluations are then integrated across the AFIRE dimensions—Administration, Formation, Instruction, Research, and Engagement—and submitted to the Vice President for Quality Assurance for institutional oversight.
    <br><br>Objective analysis is supported by structured tools such as surveys, rubrics, and key performance indicators (KPIs), which measure outcomes against strategic targets. Evaluation results are communicated transparently through Parent Meetings, Faculty Assemblies, and Student Government forums, creating feedback loops that promote accountability, shared ownership, and collaborative decision-making.
    <br><br>Aligned with the  <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o1LyiK7Y2JcqEq8P9f7GL9ZYsGMVIbVH/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">One Ateneo, One Plan (1A1P) Strategic Framework for 2018-2023</a> and the <a href="https://sites.google.com/addu.edu.ph/addu-strategic-plan/fortiores-2030?authuser=0&fbclid=IwY2xjawLij0NleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHuBdkBJfGGzpxNsUTxRVZ8so7T-QNh7jiuV5nLzscEmm6A2VI-v8lwa_DjS2_aem_Wt_-E8hMrMSPQg8yVD0PgA" target="_blank">Fortiores 2030</a>, this evaluation system embeds flexibility to respond to emerging challenges and opportunities. Adjustments to strategic goals and operational priorities are made as needed, reinforcing SHS’s culture of continuous improvement, evidence-based governance, and responsiveness to the evolving educational landscape.
