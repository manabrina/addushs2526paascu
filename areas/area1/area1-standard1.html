  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5.0</p>
  <!-- Start Explanation -->
  <p>
    The school ensures that the formulation and articulation of its vision and mission are participatory and inclusive. These foundational statements are the product of collaboration among administrators, faculty, staff, students, alumni, and external partners.
    <br><br>The development of the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VDQs52c2wW1wVtPrqMHMWaoHbEazG4_f/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">One Ateneo One Plan (1A1P) Strategic Plan for 2018–2023</a> exemplified this process. Key offices and various academic units worked with stakeholders to identify goals, outcomes, and interventions. Capacity-building activities further ensured alignment with Jesuit values and institutional priorities. This process established shared ownership of the plan across the University community.
    <br><br>The same participatory approach guided the formulation of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/addu.edu.ph/addu-strategic-plan/fortiores-2030?authuser=0&fbclid=IwY2xjawLij0NleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHuBdkBJfGGzpxNsUTxRVZ8so7T-QNh7jiuV5nLzscEmm6A2VI-v8lwa_DjS2_aem_Wt_-E8hMrMSPQg8yVD0PgA" target="_blank">Fortiores 2030.</a> Strategic Planning Conferences held in January–February 2025 brought together administrators, faculty, staff, students, and trustees. Conversations were framed by Jesuit principles of discernment and communal action, enriched by insights from regional and national leaders. Through Pakighinabi sessions and spiritual conversations, stakeholders assessed institutional strengths and challenges, identified emerging priorities, and aligned directions with ADDU’s local and global mission.
    <br><br>These participatory processes affirm that ADDU’s strategic directions are grounded in its Jesuit identity while reflecting the shared aspirations of its stakeholders, thereby strengthening collective ownership of the University’s mission and vision.

  <h3 class="criterion">Criterion 2. The vision and mission statements are communicated to the stakeholders.</h3>
  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5.0</p>
  <!-- Start Explanation -->
  <p>
    The school communicates its vision and mission through multiple platforms to ensure wide reach and engagement. During the One Ateneo One Plan (1A1P) Strategic Plan for 2018–2023, these were disseminated via official <a href="https://www.addu.edu.ph/" target="_blank">University websites</a> and <a href="https://taborasj.wordpress.com/author/joeltaborasj/page/2/" target="_blank">WordPress blogs</a>, which provided contextual information and updates. Social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter expanded the reach to students, faculty, alumni, and the public, while formal memorandums and circulars cascaded key messages internally. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ateneo.dedavao/posts/pfbid0GUuXZ6foccrsEfxyx9mqZssmFGRjC3VLuLRbk414v9XUt6X6hNNrAT6bqZpTtNJSl" target="_blank">University convocations and assemblies</a> further reinforced the vision and mission through speeches, presentations, and thematic celebrations, fostering a shared sense of purpose.
    <br><br>Parent and family engagement was strengthened through <a href="https://www.facebook.com/adduseniorhigh/posts/pfbid0xF6YEqQbzqsnWwXqc8THsVxZpDCjUBbN2QKsobpvJAgRbbCriqPvVp62C9ry3kdMl" target="_blank">Parent Meetings</a>, where the Vision and Mission were explicitly presented, highlighting their role as partners in the educational and formative journey. Students encountered the Vision and Mission not only in the curriculum, where institutional ideals were integrated across subjects, but also in <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iZFp6Zr5o6EU-aQ6fyP5LxCoiTWisEFG/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Leadership Development Programs</a>, workshops, retreats, and formation activities that facilitated active internalization.
    <br><br>Under the Fortiores 2030, the University sustained and deepened these efforts. The internal platform AdDU InSite became a dynamic channel for updates, reflections, and resources for faculty, staff, and students, while social media continued to reach a broad audience. Formal memorandums remained the primary avenue for authoritative communication, and convocations and assemblies once again served as venues for leadership to articulate and renew the Vision and Mission, fostering dialogue and shared commitment.
    <br><br>Through these intentional and sustained strategies, AdDU ensures that its Vision and Mission are not only widely communicated but also deeply internalized. This integrated approach strengthens institutional identity, guides decision-making, and fosters holistic formation across all levels of the academic community.

  <!-- Start Explanation -->
  <p>
    In the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VDQs52c2wW1wVtPrqMHMWaoHbEazG4_f/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">One Ateneo One Plan (1A1P) Strategic Plan for 2018–2023</a>, all sectors of the Ateneo de Davao University (AdDU) community meaningfully participated in an inclusive and reflective planning process. Grounded in the AFIRE framework—transformative Administration, integral Formation, excellent Instruction, robust Research, and vibrant Engagement—around seventy representatives from administration, faculty, staff, students, alumni, and trustees collaborated to reframe the University’s Vision and Mission. This collective discernment ensured that the Vision and Mission authentically embodied the University’s identity and aspirations.
    <br><br>The Vision and Mission were translated into clear goals and sub-goals mapped to the AFIRE dimensions, enabling each sector to see its specific contributions to program learning outcomes and institutional priorities. Academic instruction was aligned with the mission of forming socially responsible and competent graduates. A dedicated synthesis team consolidated contributions into a coherent set of strategic directives that connected curriculum design, formation programs, research priorities, and engagement initiatives.
    <br><br><a href="https://sites.google.com/addu.edu.ph/addu-strategic-plan/fortiores-2030?authuser=0&fbclid=IwY2xjawLij0NleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHuBdkBJfGGzpxNsUTxRVZ8so7T-QNh7jiuV5nLzscEmm6A2VI-v8lwa_DjS2_aem_Wt_-E8hMrMSPQg8yVD0PgA" target="_blank">The Fortiores 2030</a> reinforced this communal ownership through two major Strategic Planning Conferences in early 2025. Guided by Jesuit principles of discernment and prophetic leadership, these conferences engaged diverse stakeholders in critically assessing challenges and aligning directions with AdDU’s Catholic, Jesuit, and Filipino identity within the AFIRE framework. External perspectives, including insights from the Mindanao Development Authority, enriched the process and affirmed the University’s commitment to regional realities and sustainable development.
    <br><br>Academically, the Vision and Mission permeate program learning outcomes by guiding curricular design, instructional approaches, and assessment methods that cultivate intellectual competence, ethical discernment, and leadership grounded in social justice. Formation programs support holistic personal development, while research initiatives address local issues and deepen contextual understanding. Engagement efforts link the academic community to service, advocacy, and regional development, fulfilling the mission beyond the classroom.
    <br><br>Through this integrative and participatory approach, all sectors of the University have internalized and embodied the Vision and Mission. This shared ownership strengthens collective dedication to peace, justice, leadership, and sustainable development in Mindanao and beyond, making the Vision and Mission active, living guides that shape every facet of teaching, learning, research, formation, and service.

  <h3 class="criterion">Criterion 4. Clear indicators represent how the school’s vision and mission are achieved.</h3>
  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.0</p>
  <!-- Start Explanation -->
  <p>
    The school establishes clear indicators to demonstrate how its vision and mission are achieved. These indicators are aligned with the university’s strategic goals under the One Ateneo, One Plan, and the Fortiores 2030 framework, which emphasizes mission integration, academic excellence, and social engagement. 
    <br><br>The <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VDQs52c2wW1wVtPrqMHMWaoHbEazG4_f/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">key indicators of One Ateneo One Plan (1A1P) Strategic Plan for 2018–2023</a> include the deepening of faith in the community, promotion of social justice, environmental responsibility, lifelong learning, and leadership development. These indicators carried with them programs such as inter-faith dialogues, sustainability advocacies, career developments, and partnerships, indicating that the vision and mission are achieved with the help of the academe, students, and the partner communities. 
    <br><br>Ateneo de Davao University fosters a culture of continuous reflection and dialogue, ensuring that its strategic frameworks are consistently reviewed and refined even prior to their full implementation. This ongoing evaluative process guarantees relevance, responsiveness, and necessary adjustments. From One Ateneo, One Plan to the transition toward Fortiores 2030, the University affirms that its vision and mission remain dynamic, meaningful, and firmly grounded in both the lived experiences of its academic community and the evolving demands of the times.

  <h3 class="criterion">Criterion 5. The school’s vision and mission statements are periodically revisited.</h3>
  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5.0</p>
  <!-- Start Explanation -->
  <p>
    To ensure continued relevance, clarity, and alignment of the University’s vision and mission to society’s changing needs, they are periodically revisited every five years. This is done through structured processes through a university-wide initiative, which engaged administrators, faculty, staff, students, parents, alumni, and partners in reviewing and reaffirming the institution's core identity and direction.
    <br><br>The University systematically revisited the vision and mission of One Ateneo One Plan (1A1P) Strategic Plan for 2018–2023 through annual <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ateneo.dedavao/posts/pfbid024jm9XqVHwdqXAqH36VmyBnkUt9z6xdnvzmwv44Sxifs5pq6U4TXvBtjze9FNenfSl" target="_blank">University Convocations</a>, where the President’s accomplishment reports were shared with all stakeholders. At the conclusion of the plan, administrators, trustees, faculty, staff, and students engaged in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ateneo.dedavao/posts/pfbid022UVTQEJC3TP3PZ41tDo6L1AVzzyVArkiHenfwPaBzdqBog8CSAi978xnTFvqC118l" target="_blank">strategic planning sessions</a> to evaluate achievements and challenges. This evidence-based review identified institutional thrusts, strengths, and areas for improvement, which informed the development of Fortiores 2030. Guided by principles of synodality and broad consultation, the Fortiores 2030 Operational Planning translated the revised vision into commitments, programs, initiatives, and measurable outcomes. The plan is subject to annual review to ensure accountability, alignment, and continuous institutional improvement.
    <br><br>By fostering a culture of ongoing reflection and dialogue, the strategic frameworks are always subject to review even prior to their completion to ensure their relevance and the necessary adjustments. From One Ateneo, One Plan to transitioning to Fortiores 2030, Ateneo de Davao University ensures that its vision and mission remain dynamic, meaningful, and deeply rooted in the lived experience of its school community and the changing needs of time.
