<div class="section">
  <h3 class="criterion">Criterion 1. A system for formulating and implementing policies is in place.</h3>
  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.5</p>
  <!-- Start Explanation -->
  <p>
    Ateneo de Davao University Senior High School (SHS) has a well-defined and participatory system for policy formulation and implementation that governs its academic, administrative, and formative functions, as articulated in the SHS Manual of Operation. Policy development is guided by the Basic Education Council (BEC), the primary deliberative body for basic education programs, and begins with broad stakeholder consultations involving administrators, faculty representatives, and specialized committees.
    <br><br>Prior to the establishment of the Office of the Vice President for Basic Education (OVPBE), policies were deliberated within the BEC and endorsed to the University President for approval. With the creation of the OVPBE, the process has been further strengthened through the issuance of Memorandum 2025-0081, providing clear and standardized guidelines for policy formulation and implementation.
    <br><br>Within the BEC–OVPBE framework, proposed policies undergo critical review and alignment with the University’s mission and strategic directions. They are designed to be evidence-based, responsive to stakeholder needs, and reflective of best practices. Once approved, policies are cascaded with clear implementation guidelines, systematically communicated across units, and supported by monitoring mechanisms to ensure compliance and effectiveness.
    <br><br>The BEC conducts periodic reviews to evaluate policy outcomes, identify gaps, and recommend refinements, embedding a culture of feedback and continuous improvement.

  <h3 class="criterion">Criterion 2. Policies and Procedures Reflecting School Values and Unique Culture.</h3>
  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5</p>
  <!-- Start Explanation -->
  <p>
    The school ensures that its policies reflect Ignatian spirituality, academic excellence, and social responsibility, guided by magis (greater good) and cura personalis (care for the whole person). Following the general guidelines in Memo: 2025-0081, the University ensures clarity and consistency in how policies are developed, reviewed, and approved. The SHS Manual of Operation provides programs that strengthen the culture of inclusivity, respect, and transformative education is evident in the faculty, student services, and community engagement. Policies in inter-faith events, intercultural activities, academics, and non-academic programs fulfill the mission of excellence.
    <br><br>Policy proposals may originate at any level, with the VPBE discerning if they require formulation and initiating the consultative process. Principals are consulted for input and revisions to ensure participation at the school level. After refinement, the VPBE endorses the draft to the Basic Education Council (BEC) for deliberation. The BEC may approve, reject, or revise the proposal, and policies with broader or enduring impact proceed to the President’s Council and the University President for final approval. If the policy affects only Basic Education, BEC approval suffices. However, the University President may be consulted at any point if necessary. Policies promote reflective leadership, stewardship, and social justice in line with the Jesuit mission of forming leaders for others.
    <br><br>Regular dialogue with stakeholders and periodic reviews keep SHS’s policies responsive to emerging needs while remaining rooted in its Ignatian educational philosophy.

  <h3 class="criterion">Criterion 3. Policies and procedures are implemented transparently, consistently, and fairly.</h3>
  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5</p>
  <!-- Start Explanation -->
  <p>
    The school ensures that policies and procedures are implemented with transparency, consistency, and fairness. New and revised policies are disseminated through in-service trainings, faculty induction programs, and monthly faculty meetings, providing open forums for clarification and shared understanding. Implementation of these policies is reflected in the minutes of the meetings and documentation. Consistency is achieved through clear communication channels, policy manuals, bulletins, and official memos that standardize procedures across all units, ensuring their enforcement in the community, reflecting institutional integrity and uniformity. Fairness is upheld through the school’s strong commitment to due process, equity, and non-discrimination in issues and matters that may compromise information and the safety of its personnel. Policies are applied impartially, with mechanisms that protect rights and promote accountability, thereby cultivating a culture of trust and mutual respect among students, faculty, and staff.

  <h3 class="criterion">Criterion 4. Policies and procedures facilitate efficient operations.</h3>
  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5</p>
  <!-- Start Explanation -->
  <p>
    The school has established policies and procedures that ensure efficient and seamless operations across its core functions. A prime example is the One-Stop-Shop Enrollment Process, which consolidates registration, document verification, interview scheduling, and payment into a single coordinated flow. This streamlined system minimizes bureaucratic steps, reduces waiting times, and enhances convenience for students and parents, demonstrating the school’s commitment to operational efficiency.
    <br><br>Other administrative processes—including class scheduling, guidance services, and document requests—are similarly guided by clear policies, supported by electronic record-keeping, and managed by designated officers. These procedures ensure timely service delivery, systematic communication, and easy access to student and parent services.
    <br><br>Efficiency measures are continuously strengthened through feedback mechanisms such as faculty meetings, administrative reviews, and parent consultations. This ongoing process of refinement promotes responsiveness, service quality, and stakeholder satisfaction, aligning SHS operations with its strategic goals.

  <h3 class="criterion">Criterion 5. There are specific policies for teaching and learning processes, student discipline, research activities, community engagement initiatives, and support services.</h3>
  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.5</p>
  <!-- Start Explanation -->
  <p>
    The school has instituted well-defined policies that comprehensively guide teaching and learning, student discipline, research, community engagement, and support services. The Academics - Manual of Operations specifies standards for teaching methodologies, classroom management, assessments, examinations, and grade appeals, ensuring academic excellence and fairness. Policies about students’ discipline are reflected in the Student Code of Conduct in the Learner’s Manual, which outlines expected behaviors, academic integrity policies, and disciplinary procedures. These are reinforced by the adherence of the Prefect of Discipline and formation offices, ensuring that due process is observed through coordination with students, teachers, the disciplinary board, and other formative units.
    <br><br>Research and community engagement are also supported through institutionalized structures. The University Research Council and Practical Research cluster adheres to its mandate on guiding both the faculty and students in appropriate research design, providing financial, publication processes, and professional support. Community engagement is formalized through the University Community Engagement and Advocacy Council, the Arrupe Office of Social Formation, and curriculum-integrated service projects, fostering meaningful partnerships with communities and encouraging socio-civic involvement.

  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5</p>
  <!-- Start Explanation -->
  <p>
    There are established comprehensive policies regarding the recruitment, employment, and management of both teaching and non-teaching personnel. This framework is documented in two key University resources: the HRMDO Manual of Operations for announcements of open positions in online and printed job postings that detail the job description, requirements and qualifications, the skills needed, and the role and responsibilities of the open positions. Pre-selected applicants undergo rigid screening, aptitude, and psychological tests to evaluate their fitness for the job. The school administrators and HRMDO supervise the training and orientation of the hired applicants, including the orientation of the Administrative Manual outlining their roles, responsibilities, compensation, statutory and other employment benefits, and other procedures associated with personnel management.
