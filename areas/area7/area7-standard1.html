  <!-- Start Explanation -->
  <p class="explanation">
    The Ateneo de Davao University has a University Research Council (URC) which provides leadership and oversight in advancing the <a href="#" target="_blank">institution’s research agenda</a>. Anchored on the University’s vision and mission, robust research and publication efforts guided by the A.F.I.R.E. principles of the 1A1P Strategic Plan and the Sustainable Development Goals, the URC supports faculty and staff through funding, capacity-building, and ethical guidance to ensure that research initiatives contribute to academic excellence, community engagement, and innovation. In line with this, faculty and staff are actively encouraged to undertake various <a href="#" target="_blank">research endeavors</a>, reinforcing a shared culture of inquiry, discovery, and scholarly collaboration across the University.
    <br><br>Additionally, the school designs its research curriculum by embedding research activities that hone the research skills of its learners in <a href="#" target="_blank">Practical Research 1</a>, <a href="#" target="_blank">Practical Research 2</a>, <a href="#" target="_blank">Inquiries, Investigations and Immersion</a>, and <a href="#" target="_blank">Capstone Research Projects</a> anchored in the school’s vision and mission. These subjects are thoroughly designed to build learners' skills progressively, culminating in <a href="#" target="_blank">meaningful and relevant research studies and outputs</a>. A collaborative process is central to this effort, as learners <a href="#" target="_blank">undergo a series of consultations</a> with their research teachers to refine and validate their research studies before approval. This process ensures that learners receive expert guidance, uphold high standards of academic rigor, and produce research studies that are age-appropriate, strand-relevant, and responsive to real-world contexts, while also cultivating in them the Ignatian values of inquiry, reflection, and service to society.

  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.5</p>
  <!-- Start Explanation -->
  <p class="explanation">
    Research subjects (<a href="#" target="_blank">Practical Research 1</a>, <a href="#" target="_blank">Practical Research 2</a>, <a href="#" target="_blank">Inquiries, Investigations, and Immersion</a>) are taken by all learners as part of the curriculum mandated by the Department of Education (DepEd). In these subjects, learners are required to come up with a qualitative or quantitative research projects as part of their academic requirements. The school actively recognizes and celebrates learners’ research achievements in these classes, ensuring their efforts are acknowledged and shared with the broader community. At the end of each school year, a dedicated <a href="#" target="_blank">research dissemination</a> event is held to showcase learners' outputs. This event provides a platform for learners to present their findings both through oral presentations and through posters, promoting academic dialogue and peer learning.
    <br><br>To further highlight exceptional work, the best research projects in both <a href="#" target="_blank">qualitative</a> and <a href="#" target="_blank">quantitative</a> categories from each section are selected and featured on the school’s official Facebook page. This not only serves as an avenue for recognition but also inspires other learners to pursue high-quality research. Moreover, the groups with the best research paper per strand and presentation per research approach are awarded the <a href="#" target="_blank">Christopher Clavius Award and the Georges Lemaîre Award</a>, respectively, to recognize their contribution to their research field. Integrating research dissemination and recognition into the academic program emphasizes the unit’s commitment to nurturing scholarly excellence and fostering a vibrant research culture. These awards are aligned with the <a href="#" target="_blank">rubric of the Department of Education’s Award for Research or Innovation</a>. In addition to these initiatives, the unit also takes pride in the publication of outstanding student <a href="#" target="_blank">research papers in different interdisciplinary journals</a>, as well as the active participation of learners in <a href="#" target="_blank">research-related activities</a>.
