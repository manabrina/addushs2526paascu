  <h3 class="criterion">Criterion 1. The school promotes a research culture by developing students’ research skills through age-appropriate research activities aligned with the school’s vision and mission and by encouraging personnel to conduct research.</h3>
  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.0</p>
  <!-- Start Explanation -->
  <p class="explanation">
    The Ateneo de Davao University has a University Research Council (URC) which provides leadership and oversight in advancing the institution’s research agenda. Anchored on the University’s vision and mission, robust research and publication efforts guided by the A.F.I.R.E. principles of the 1A1P Strategic Plan and the Sustainable Development Goals, the URC supports faculty and staff through funding, capacity-building, and ethical guidance to ensure that research initiatives contribute to academic excellence, community engagement, and innovation. In line with this, faculty and staff are actively encouraged to undertake various research endeavors, reinforcing a shared culture of inquiry, discovery, and scholarly collaboration across the University.
    <br><br>Additionally, the school designs its research curriculum by embedding research activities that hone the research skills of its learners in Practical Research 1, Practical Research 2, Inquiries, Investigations and Immersion, and Capstone Research Projects anchored in the school’s vision and mission. These subjects are thoroughly designed to build learners' skills progressively, culminating in meaningful and relevant research studies and outputs. A collaborative process is central to this effort, as learners undergo a series of consultations with their research teachers to refine and validate their research studies before approval. This process ensures that learners receive expert guidance, uphold high standards of academic rigor, and produce research studies that are age-appropriate, strand-relevant, and responsive to real-world contexts, while also cultivating in them the Ignatian values of inquiry, reflection, and service to society.

  <h3 class="criterion">Criterion 2. The school provides support for the promotion of a culture of research.</h3>
  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.5</p>
  <!-- Start Explanation -->
  <p class="explanation">
    The University actively promotes a culture of research by providing faculty with research budgets and honoraria through the URC, as well as honoraria and incentives for those who publish research or author books. These forms of support recognize and reward scholarly contributions while encouraging educators to prioritize research endeavors, thereby reinforcing the University’s commitment to academic excellence, innovation, and knowledge creation. Teachers disseminate their research findings to the community, fostering knowledge-sharing and practical applications of their work. To further equip teachers with the needed skills to effectively teach research in the classroom, the school organizes growth sessions, such as workshops on data collection and analysis for qualitative research and research methods. 
    <br><br>Likewise, learners receive instruction and guidance from research advisers through weekly classroom sessions and consultations. They are given opportunities to present their research to a panel of strand-aligned teachers who provide insights and feedback to help improve their studies. Outstanding research studies are also recognized through awards at the classroom level, strand level, and best presenters for qualitative and quantitative research. The school also provides access to digital resources and other resources, along with administrative support for data collection, such as population requests for learners, scholars, and teachers, and community service hours for data collection participation. Learners are also encouraged to pursue topics relevant to their interests and communities. In addition, select learner research outputs have been successfully published in international journals, demonstrating the school’s commitment to advancing research excellence beyond the classroom. Learners also actively participate in co-curricular research activities such as conferences, symposia, and research pitching events, further strengthening their engagement in scholarly work and nurturing a vibrant culture of research in the school.

  <h3 class="criterion">Criterion 3. Research and research-related activities are part of the academic program, and there are provisions for recognizing learners’ research outputs.</h3>
  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.5</p>
  <!-- Start Explanation -->
  <p class="explanation">
    Research subjects (Practical Research 1, Practical Research 2, Inquiries, Investigations, and Immersion) are taken by all learners as part of the curriculum mandated by the Department of Education (DepEd). In these subjects, learners are required to come up with a qualitative or quantitative research projects as part of their academic requirements. The school actively recognizes and celebrates learners’ research achievements in these classes, ensuring their efforts are acknowledged and shared with the broader community. At the end of each school year, a dedicated research dissemination event is held to showcase learners' outputs. This event provides a platform for learners to present their findings both through oral presentations and through posters, promoting academic dialogue and peer learning.
    <br><br>To further highlight exceptional work, the best research projects in both qualitative and quantitative categories from each section are selected and featured on the school’s official Facebook page. This not only serves as an avenue for recognition but also inspires other learners to pursue high-quality research. Moreover, the groups with the best research paper per strand and presentation per research approach are awarded the Christopher Clavius Award and the Georges Lemaîre Award, respectively, to recognize their contribution to their research field. Integrating research dissemination and recognition into the academic program emphasizes the unit’s commitment to nurturing scholarly excellence and fostering a vibrant research culture. These awards are aligned with the rubric of the Department of Education’s Award for Research or Innovation. In addition to these initiatives, the unit also takes pride in the publication of outstanding student research papers in different interdisciplinary journals, as well as the active participation of learners in research-related activities.

  <p class="explanation">
    The school systematically assesses research activities to ensure the progressive development of learners’ skills through formative tasks such as chapter drafts and consultations with research teachers, leading to summative outputs. Practical Research 1 and Practical Research 2 equip students with age-appropriate qualitative and quantitative research skills tailored to their academic strand, while the Inquiries, Investigations, and Immersion subject enables them to select and further develop a strand-relevant proposal into their final research project for the year.
    <br><br>In addition, rubrics are consistently used to evaluate research outputs, focusing on critical competencies such as analytical thinking and ethical considerations, while research presentations at the classroom, strand, and school levels are assessed by panels using established criteria. 
    <br><br>Finally, regular reviews and cluster meetings by the research teachers ensure that activities remain aligned to enhance learners’ research capabilities and prepare them for academic and real-world challenges.
