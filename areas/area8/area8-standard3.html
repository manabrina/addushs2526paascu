  <p>
    The development of learners’ research skills is closely monitored through structured assessments embedded in the curriculum. It is integrated in core and strand-specific subjects, where learners are guided through identifying research problems, reviewing literature, applying methodologies, analyzing data, and presenting findings. This includes performance in research-related subjects such as <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11uaWC1jlIJJBUhJ-iP3JNBoWHuXNoNWV/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Practical Research 1</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vsO_btTr2IshvTH4DXiLF8AD7wE9vuqA/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Practical Research 2</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L7Y7njmKV9lz_PaHWeaLpT2ddsZ0j_v1/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Applied Inquiries, Investigations and Immersion</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rx5qINAsFqdvh7JlxhA0c6WROHFxUd0h/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Capstone Research Project</a>, and other strand-specific research requirements. The school provides structured opportunities within the curriculum and co-curricular programs to develop the research skills of learners. The results of these provisions are monitored through academic <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nors6VQ6GfRftCVezdC1Ccq8U96zsI5I?usp=sharing" target="_blank">cluster meetings</a>.
    <br><br>They are then evaluated through student performance in research defenses and Research Dissemination <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QagO0uZOdOr3FUIH0Pg0WUSc46fsA-xc?usp=sharing" target="_blank">evaluation forms</a>. Comparative data are gathered annually to track trends in research output, such as the number and quality of completed studies per strand. In addition, feedback from panel members, advisers, and external evaluators is used to assess the depth, relevance, and quality of research outputs. The evaluation also considers learner performance in <a href="https://web.facebook.com/adduseniorhigh/posts/pfbid0U81PVurL551sj6zXLxYtc9xVj5AWGYNiahiLzZEZS9LC27ARfzoQqKeEb9anbNjWl?__cft__%5B0%5D=AZWLYPKTviUEyGhm88ouxmjWBuxrnGChGA5zj_KYjRJdS9RdT6iJryjHYjxXN2iEccDvjgJC7ER2Wyb2FKiz6cUd9bIvNfX1IMAGCIMFmyaht8HGnnYCYP3JZbAjWKhbDNs_cbHQnll5CKgj5W9AKXmQ61f-o3KCnIV7fot9ovdw8z3abpt66u4uGthtlQR52-w&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R" target="_blank">research dissemination</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gsu9CKAtZvlKIm9pqge-pPvVMtdbtBD9/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113853589753913322351&rtpof=true&sd=true" target="_blank">publications</a>, which serve as external validation of research competence.

  <h3 class="criterion" id="criterion-2">Criterion 2. The nature and number of research outputs produced by personnel and learners are documented, monitored, and assessed for improvement.</h3>
  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.2</p>
  <p>
    The school actively supports and documents the production of research outputs by personnel and learners. Research outputs of both personnel and learners are systematically documented. The Research Cluster maintains comprehensive records of <a href="https://opaclibrary.addu.edu.ph/?config=SHSLRC#section=search&term=shs&page=0&sortKey=Relevancy&db=ls2pac&branchFilters=%5B%221%22%5D&facetFilters=%5B%5D&audience=%5B%5D" target="_blank">learners' research studies</a> of learners. For personnel, scholarly publications, conference presentations, and faculty-led studies are cataloged annually by STADECO (Staff, Teachers, Administrators Development Coordinators Office) through the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pX83F3oFYrfWCWB3rHxCKys7DUiZHQ0d/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">University Research Council website</a>. Research projects are documented, with final outputs archived in the Learning Resource Center. The annual research forum provides venues for presenting student work, while selected outputs are endorsed for external competitions, forums, and conferences.
    <br><br>The documentation is regularly monitored to track research productivity and quality across strands and among faculty members. Learners’ outputs are monitored through the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_e4j_NOgMaNDptb9kxejO7r1CjzISMGf?usp=sharing" target="_blank">evaluation of proposals, oral defenses, and final submissions</a>, ensuring compliance with academic standards. For personnel, STADECO monitors research through its <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xbTIzgfCeZCXscgmtyWxz-L1Bi5r1xzx/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">matrix of faculty-led studies</a>, which records the number, type, and progress of initiatives each year. This matrix identifies trends, compares output across academic years, and highlights strengths and areas for improvement. Monitoring also extends to participation in <a href="https://web.facebook.com/adduseniorhigh/posts/pfbid0U81PVurL551sj6zXLxYtc9xVj5AWGYNiahiLzZEZS9LC27ARfzoQqKeEb9anbNjWl?__cft__%5B0%5D=AZWLYPKTviUEyGhm88ouxmjWBuxrnGChGA5zj_KYjRJdS9RdT6iJryjHYjxXN2iEccDvjgJC7ER2Wyb2FKiz6cUd9bIvNfX1IMAGCIMFmyaht8HGnnYCYP3JZbAjWKhbDNs_cbHQnll5CKgj5W9AKXmQ61f-o3KCnIV7fot9ovdw8z3abpt66u4uGthtlQR52-w&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R" target="_blank">research dissemination</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Fzv1e-zaBoYnmJOmGTKV5OOhmVJ3Oygq?usp=sharing" target="_blank">publications</a>, providing a broader picture of research engagement.
    <br><br>For learners, rubrics and panel feedback during proposal and final defenses ensure methodological rigor, originality, and contribution to knowledge. For personnel, assessment includes evaluating the scholarly impact of research outputs in academic cluster meetings to inform improvement strategies. These include targeted mentoring, research methodology training, increased resource allocation, or collaborative projects. Findings also strengthen faculty development programs spearheaded by STADECO and embed best practices in student research training.

  <h3 class="criterion" id="criterion-3">Criterion 3. The nature and number of creative work and intellectual properties produced by personnel and learners are documented, monitored, and assessed for improvement.</h3>
  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.0</p>
  <p>
    The school encourages and supports the production of creative works and intellectual properties (IPs) as integral components of holistic education. Both learners and personnel are given avenues to demonstrate creativity, innovation, and critical expression through literary, artistic, performance-based, and multimedia outputs. These works not only enrich the school’s academic and cultural life but also serve as platforms for developing higher-order thinking and innovation skills.
    <br><br>Creative works and intellectual properties are systematically documented across different strands and units. For learners, outputs include literary and artistic pieces, multimedia projects, design innovations, and performance-based works produced in courses such as Creative Writing, Creative Non-Fiction, Contemporary Philippine Arts from the Regions, Graphics, Animation, and Multimedia Technologies. These outputs are archived through student publications, school-wide contests, exhibits, and cultural showcases. For personnel, documentation covers creative projects, faculty contributions to cultural events, and professional outputs. Initiatives such as the Christ the King (CTK) essay-writing competition for teachers are formally recorded through documentation as part of the faculty’s creative contributions.
    <br><br>The school ensures that creative works are monitored through classroom-based tracking, faculty reports, and club-based records. Subject teachers maintain a list of learners’ creative outputs as part of academic requirements, while clubs under the Arts and Culture Cluster (e.g., visual arts, music, theater) submit reports and program documentation. At the unit level, minutes of meetings and activity reports capture faculty and personnel contributions. This monitoring ensures that both the volume and variety of creative works are consistently accounted for, serving as inputs to institutional records and cultural programming.
    <br><br>Creative works are assessed using academic rubrics that measure originality, technical execution, thematic depth, and relevance. Learner outputs are evaluated by subject teachers, panel reviewers (for major projects), and judges during competitions. Personnel outputs, such as essays or cultural contributions, are assessed within the framework of institutional celebrations and faculty development activities. Assessment results are discussed in strand-level meetings and faculty development sessions, with feedback used to enhance program design, curriculum alignment, and resource allocation. Improvement strategies include more interdisciplinary showcases, training workshops for faculty and learners, and opportunities for external exhibitions or collaborations.
