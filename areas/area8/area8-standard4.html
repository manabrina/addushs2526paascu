  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.5</p>
  <p>
   In Ateneo de Davao University, all expenditures made by all units and departments adhere strictly to the approved budget. Specifically, departments responsible for acquiring furniture, IT equipment, and overseeing infrastructure development, such as the Purchasing Department, Physical Plant Offices, and UITO, collaborate closely with the Finance Office throughout the entire asset procurement, monitoring, and disposal processes.
  <br><br>The Purchasing Office handles the procurement of requested items from various offices. The Physical Plant Office supervises and guarantees the upkeep and conservation of the university's assets. The UITO concentrates on overseeing and maintaining the University's IT equipment, encompassing both hardware and software. In the Finance Office, following the budget verification, responsibilities include payment processing for acquired assets and maintaining the accounting records related to the University's assets. Hence, in the budget creation process, it is important to note that the assets for acquisition will be included in the budget proposal.
  <br><br>In terms of valuation of the property and equipment, revaluations are carried out every 5 years so that the carrying amount of the asset does not differ materially from its fair value at the Financial Statement date. An independent and professional property appraiser is hired to conduct valuations and submit appraisal reports. 
  <br><br>The asset disposal procedures of the University begin with identifying the condition and value of the unused or obsolete assets, followed by formal requests (asset disposal form) for disposal and evaluation by the departments. Requests are then evaluated by the UITO and PPO. Recognized unused or obsolete assets may be subject to bidding, recycling, scrapping, or donations to other schools or communities.  The Finance Office participates in the disposal process by keeping and monitoring the records of the disposal, as well as the Fixed Asset Lapsing.

    The Ateneo de Davao University mainly generates revenue and sustains its overall operations through the collection of tuition and miscellaneous fees from the enrolled learners. Tuition fees are primarily allocated to cover employee salaries, wages, and benefits, while miscellaneous fees have specific purposes as to their utilization.
    <br><br>In the creation of the annual budget, it usually begins with the budget call. The participation and collaboration of the different units involved in proposing, consulting, evaluating the office’s budget for upcoming school year is very crucial in the development of the annual budget and implementation of the planned activities, research, and academic instructions.
    <br><br>The formulation of the annual budget is fundamental not only in strategically identifying the budget of expenditures for the new school year but also the recognition of revenue that will be funding its implementation.
    <br><br>To guide the various units and offices in the implementation of its planned academic and other activities for the school year, a proposed Statement of Budget of Revenues and Expenses is prepared and distributed. The Statement of Budget of Revenues and Expenses also presents the enrollment projections and tuition and fees which are the bases in identifying the projected income for the school year. The proposed budget of the different offices and units are assessed and approved based on the projected income for the school year as well as based on the validity of the proposed expense items.
    <br><br>It is also crucial for each unit to know their budget in research and activities ahead of time to plan and trace their expenses and avoid insufficient budget. Thus as a means of support to the units, to easily track and monitor the budget utilization, all University units, clusters and offices’ heads are provided with the access to the AdDU Budget Portal. The Finance Office together with the University MIS maintain the portal ensuring that only Authorized personnel or Unit Heads can access and navigate the portal to aid them in planning and in budget utilization.

  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.8</p>

    The AdDU Finance Office takes a dynamic and comprehensive approach towards establishing, continually monitoring, and systematically evaluating cash flows. Since the University’s collection is purely from the Tuition and Miscellaneous fees, it is prudent that the Finance office can maintain the monthly requirement to fund the operations. Thus, the Finance Office ensures the collection of receivables during examination periods and during enrolment. Updating the parents and the learners on their payables through sending statement accounts prior to the scheduled examination period and by having the learners’ balances available for viewing through the Basic Ed Portal will not only help the University collect its receivables but also provide them with the necessary information to plan their school fee payment. Thus, the parents and learners can also view the information needed in the student handbook.  
    <br><br>Learners, parents, and guardians are given the option to pay the school fees through the University Cashier counters, online banking or through the University accredited payment centers. The lists of the Accredited Payment centers are provided through the student portals, letters and memos, and through the AdDU Finance Office Facebook page.
    <br><br>In terms of expenses, the implementation of payment to suppliers is carefully planned and prioritized. The University ensures payment of salaries and wages, outside services, utilities, government-mandated contributions, and other non-negotiable obligations through effective cash flow management. Thus, during the pandemic in the year 2020, the initiative of the University President greatly manifested its support to the faculty and staff of the Ateneo de Davao University through the assurance of complete payment of the salaries and wages of the University’s personnel.
    <br><br>Through diligent process, it allows the University to maintain financial stability, allocate resources judiciously even during pandemic, and continuously seek opportunities for enhancement. With the continuous monitoring of cash flows, the University can ensure efficient allocation of financial resources to various academic and administrative endeavors, ultimately supporting its overarching mission of providing quality education, research, and services to its learners and the community.
