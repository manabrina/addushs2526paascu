  <h3 class="criterion" id="criterion-1">Criterion 1. The results of the implementation of the school curriculum and programs are monitored, evaluated, and continually improved.</h3>
  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.0</p>
  <p>
    The implementation of the curriculum is systematically monitored through classroom observations, lesson plan reviews (Weekly Educators’ Journal), curriculum alignment framework, and regular cluster and administrators’ meetings. Feedback is also gathered from learners through evaluation forms, exit curriculum surveys, and from parents and faculty convergence feedback. Data from formative and summative assessments, exit exams, and achievement tests serve as inputs in evaluating the achieved curriculum.
    <br><br>These results provide evidence of what learners have actually gained, highlighting both strengths and gaps in delivery. Based on the findings, the school plans and implements interventions, including curriculum vertical articulation and faculty development activities on innovative teaching strategies.
    <br><br>Evaluation results are consistently translated into program improvements. Curriculum revisions are periodically undertaken to align with DepEd requirements. Faculty receive training and mentoring in pedagogy and assessment, while enrichment activities and integration of technology are introduced. Through this cycle of monitoring, evaluation, and improvement, the school ensures that its programs remain relevant, effective, and responsive, rooted in the Ignatian value of holistic formation.

  <h3 class="criterion" id="criterion-2">Criterion 2. The pass and failure rates in all subjects are consistently monitored, reviewed, and evaluated to improve learning across all subjects.</h3>
  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.0</p>
  <p>
    The school consistently monitors pass and failure rates across all subjects over the past three years, disaggregated by grade level and grading period. Monitoring is done by subject teachers and cluster leaders through the assessment tracker, while teachers also update the SHS Unified Monitoring (SUM) Sheet to record the performance of Learners Needing Intervention (LNI). This information supports class advisers in closely tracking student progress.
    <br><br>Pass and failure rates are then reviewed every grading period by the chairpersons and cluster leaders, under the supervision of the Office of the Assistant Principal for Academics. During academic-administration meetings, data are interpreted in greater depth, allowing for comparisons of pass/fail trends across grade levels and semesters. These reviews ensure that emerging patterns and concerns are clearly identified and addressed.
    <br><br>Finally, the data are evaluated to improve programs and interventions. Results are analyzed to determine the causes of subject failures and to design responsive measures. Interventions include semester retakes for failed subjects, with performance closely reviewed to check mastery, as well as summer learning camps to address the least-mastered competencies. Convergence meetings and collaborative interventions with the WTC and other offices further strengthen academic support.

  <h3 class="criterion" id="criterion-3">Criterion 3. The promotion and retention rates per grade level are monitored, reviewed, and evaluated for improvement.</h3>
  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.4</p>
  <p>
    The school consistently monitors learners’ promotion and retention rates per grade level to ensure alignment with academic policies and progression goals. Monitoring is carried out by teachers, strand chairs, and academic administrators, guided by the promotion standards in the Learner’s Manual and DepEd policies, which require learners to demonstrate mastery of core competencies through passing grades in all subjects. Faculty submit grades at the end of each semester, which are consolidated by the Registrar into official promotion reports.
    <br><br>Promotion data are reviewed by the assistant principal for academics, strand chairs, and guidance counselors during academic cluster meetings. These reviews include trend analysis across grade levels and years, identification of subjects or areas with higher retention rates, and discussion of possible causes such as academic readiness, attendance, or behavioral concerns. This process allows for early detection of at-risk learners and the planning of timely interventions.
    <br><br>The results are then evaluated to improve support systems. Learners who fall short of promotion standards are formally identified for subject retakes, remedial, or enrichment programs. Guidance counselors, in coordination with parents, establish support plans to help learners meet required competencies. Evaluation also includes follow-up on learners who underwent interventions to check progress.
    <br><br>The system is strong, consistent, and effective, as reflected in relatively stable promotion rates and the low percentage of retained learners.

  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.0</p>
  <p>
    The school monitors and reviews learners’ performance in external examinations, such as college admission and placement tests. The ADDU College Admission Offices provide diagnostic results and other standardized test data, which are consolidated annually to assess learner preparedness, curriculum alignment, and competency mastery. In 2024, monitoring showed that about 60–65% of graduates proceeded to Ateneo de Davao University, while the rest enrolled in other universities.
    <br><br>These results are then evaluated to guide academic planning for the succeeding school year. When underperformance is noted in specific subjects or competencies, the Assistant Principal and cluster leaders adjust instructional strategies, assessment practices, and enrichment activities as discussed in academic meetings.

  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3.5</p>
  <p>
    The school has established mechanisms to gather feedback from key stakeholders—learners, parents, faculty, alumni, and the partner community on the quality of its graduates and educational offerings. Feedback is obtained through Google Form satisfaction surveys, parents’ consultation meetings, and academic-administration meeting minutes, which contribute to institutional reflection. The school also considers valuable insights from parents, alumni, and college professors, particularly those from AdDU College who have directly engaged with our graduates.
    <br><br>In line with continuous improvement, the school has developed a standardized one-page survey tool for deans and professors to formally assess satisfaction with the preparedness of graduates, including curriculum relevance. The school also administers survey tools for alumni and parents to strengthen stakeholder feedback mechanisms. Results of these feedback processes are discussed during academic-admin meetings to sustain best practices and address areas for enhancement.
