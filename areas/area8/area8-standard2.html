    Community engagement and service activities are identified through the efforts of the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_QlWw7ZKoSFdjD6LQusmilZZIMvA70cj/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Arrupe Office for Social Formation</a>. Each activity is aligned with the school’s mission of forming servant-leaders and adheres to Ignatian values of service and social responsibility, following the guidelines of the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14KRfT7ov1my-tbwtb6CjAnoje0VetaAu?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Community Engagement Program and Services for Arrupe Office for Social Formation</a>. <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p1WQZMWOfVDVRbw8GYaIoAoAaStVqbWu?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Proposals for activities</a> are formally submitted, detailing the objectives, target beneficiaries, nature of service (e.g., tutorials, environmental campaigns, relief operations), and expected outcomes. These proposals are documented and reviewed to ensure that engagements respond to both the needs of the community and the developmental goals of the learners.
    <br><br>Once approved, activities are closely monitored by the coordinator of the Arrupe Office for Social Formation following the school’s <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lop9GF-k2pDbUjpN4nfWAb8JEC-apyLh/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">monitoring system</a> to ensure that engagements are being implemented as intended and that beneficiaries are actively participating.
    <br><br>After implementation, the activities are assessed through both quantitative and qualitative measures, following the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gNYoNPjsZ_D_SjGyLtnF-x6o64d8BnRG?usp=sharing" target="_blank">impact assessment tool</a>. Quantitative data include the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13zMSQ5P33zLCKd5dIoNngfVRxZMFtwUokRpPoTQ_RE4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">volume of activities</a> (e.g., number of projects conducted, number of learners and beneficiaries served, hours of engagement). Qualitative assessment includes <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ixdDRHTe6-t1hCCqApg2kpUsYO0q14Pe?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">reflection papers</a>. This assessment helps determine the relevance, effectiveness, and impact of each activity.
    <br><br>The system has been effective in providing meaningful service experiences for learners, as reflected in the scope of community engagement programs and the high level of student involvement.

  <p>
    The impact of community engagement and service activities is identified through multiple mechanisms. For learners, impacts are recognized through <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ixdDRHTe6-t1hCCqApg2kpUsYO0q14Pe?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">reflection papers</a> where they articulate personal growth in values, leadership, and social responsibility. For personnel, feedback is gathered through <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xrH5Zq15K3fHJpf9TMfgIuxCqcz4cTtw/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113853589753913322351&rtpof=true&sd=true" target="_blank">faculty reflections</a> to capture professional development and community engagement insights. This multi-source identification ensures that impacts are systematically recognized.
    <br><br>The school regularly monitors the impact of community engagement through the Community Engagement <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-MoxFx1DfXYdZtFL8WLGxwbd0pXO1JN_?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Club Report</a>. Learners’ participation in community engagement activities is documented and reviewed by class moderators and formation coordinators using the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ixdDRHTe6-t1hCCqApg2kpUsYO0q14Pe?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">evaluation for each class</a> to ensure that intended outcomes are being met. Personnel involvement is monitored through office-level reports and formation office documentation, which track the extent and quality of participation. Monitoring also extends to how these activities foster cross-sectoral collaboration within the school community, reinforcing the Jesuit mission of service.
    <br><br>The impact of these activities is likewise assessed through <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OxSlAJsCunJ7hO04f8Pdyvwz5Vc_GTav/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">feedback forms (Learners’ Evaluation to the Community)</a>. The results are then used to revise activity design, improve partnerships, and enhance training modules for both learners and personnel. Starting this academic year, a more structured <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tu5h2iETOOeH4oy2G_yEwB-SDSlZd4bz?usp=sharing" target="_blank">impact assessment tool</a> will be applied to ensure consistency and to further strengthen evidence-based improvement. This ensures that the effects of community engagement remain meaningful, measurable, and responsive to the needs of the school community.

    The school identifies the impact of its community engagement and service activities through formal documentation and feedback mechanisms. Beneficiaries and stakeholders articulate the benefits they will gain from the programs via <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o70UecxNM2Uxoa1D641gSncUtLXSugVi/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Partnership Agreement Guidelines</a> facilitated by the Arrupe Office of Social Formation. It is also identified through <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DvuEJiHSE-T-xGDMhk95Nlm5wbPn41N7?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">Community Engagement Concept Papers</a>, which articulate expected outcomes for both learners and community partners, and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PCNSSzVekLGmiV4DqUWBJlS7HdKaODbB/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">MOA/MOU</a> agreements, which specify objectives and target beneficiaries.
    <br><br>The impact of these activities is monitored through systematic feedback mechanisms. Beneficiaries provide inputs via <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YdlwGhp6cqPg48WXN7KszMcsVV7fibZY/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">evaluation forms</a>, which are consolidated by the Arrupe Office. Monitoring is further supported by the Arrupe Office’s <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Vj2T4TiksVfhaDPJY9I4LSaKfB-FuYN9?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Documentation Summary</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13KoCD7YPQWCzB96UdPPJ1gp-QTfL8Hlv/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Monitoring and Evaluation System</a>, which records both quantitative data (e.g., number of beneficiaries, resources mobilized) and qualitative insights (e.g., narratives, reflections). Reports are also discussed during unit-level meetings, ensuring that monitoring outcomes guide program adjustments and alignment with the objectives.
    <br><br>The feedback from the beneficiaries is assessed to determine how effectively community engagement activities achieve their intended outcomes. Feedback from community partners and stakeholders is analyzed to identify best practices, challenges, and areas for enhancement. This year, the school will implement a comprehensive <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EsCpIMLcI6JapEFuCcERI3wKRpawFTqq?usp=sharing" target="_blank">impact assessment tool</a>, designed to systematize data gathering, integrate findings across projects, and ensure that results inform the refinement of future initiatives. This will enable the school to more effectively measure how community engagement initiatives influence student formation, faculty and staff development, institutional identity, and community transformation.
