    The Ateneo de Davao University Senior High School has a system for recruitment, admission, and placement of learners. The Admission and Aid Office manages both the recruitment and admission of students, guided by the structured framework and policies in the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dnIkgSy3UJCPa4dB4lnTyDF2qbmRitoG" target="_blank">SHS - Manual of Operations</a> that ensure a careful process in recruiting students, admitting qualified individuals, and promoting students from Grade 11 to Grade 12.
    <br><br>The office also follows a dynamic <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1X0m3kS8hudyd_ObrBftbdqsLbMwT6Jth" target="_blank">Marketing Plan</a> that guides the strategic implementation of campaigns. <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wVsKYtTtl19_aWhV0nQZcyY9Vo0cpeY4" target="_blank">Recruitment initiatives</a> include school visits, caravans, open house events, social media campaigns, and online pre-registration to actively engage prospective students.
    <br><br>The <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dnIkgSy3UJCPa4dB4lnTyDF2qbmRitoG" target="_blank">admission system</a> follows the requirements, policies, and procedures in compliance with the Department of Education and the university standards and qualifications.
    <br><br>The Wellness and Testing Center handles the placement of learners. For a systematic <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZIHwDeNczwB21C9NoI5cfrzgUPLztNKu/edit" target="_blank">placement</a>, students undergo Placement Tests (SHS-Career Readiness Assessment) and Diagnostic Exams in Math and English to determine readiness, address learning gaps, and align learners with suitable academic and career pathways.
