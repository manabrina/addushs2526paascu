    The Ateneo de Davao University Senior High School has a system for recruitment, admission, and placement of learners. The Admission and Aid Office manages both the recruitment and admission of students, guided by the structured framework and policies in the <a href="#" target="_blank">SHS - Manual of Operations</a> that ensure a careful process in recruiting students, admitting qualified individuals, and promoting students from Grade 11 to Grade 12.
    <br><br>The office also follows a dynamic <a href="#" target="_blank">Marketing Plan</a> that guides the strategic implementation of campaigns. <a href="#" target="_blank">Recruitment initiatives</a> include school visits, caravans, open house events, social media campaigns, and online pre-registration to actively engage prospective students.
    <br><br>The <a href="#" target="_blank">admission system</a> follows the requirements, policies, and procedures in compliance with the Department of Education and the university standards and qualifications.
    <br><br>The Wellness and Testing Center handles the placement of learners. For a systematic <a href="#" target="_blank">placement</a>, students undergo Placement Tests (SHS-Career Readiness Assessment) and Diagnostic Exams in Math and English to determine readiness, address learning gaps, and align learners with suitable academic and career pathways.

    The student’s selection and placement criteria are defined in the Admission Policies and Placement Policies of the <a href="#" target="_blank">Senior High School’s Manual of Operations</a>.
    <br><br>During enrollment, learners and their parents are oriented on the <a href="#" target="_blank">curriculum</a>, <a href="#" target="_blank">academic strands</a>, <a href="#" target="_blank">pathways, and electives</a> to support informed decision-making. The Wellness and Testing Center conducts interviews, diagnostic tests, and appraisal services to assess mental ability, aptitude, interests, and learning styles, while maintaining individual inventory records to guide placement and career pathways. Policies on strand placement and strand shifting after Grade 11 further promote proper matching, while <a href="#" target="_blank">enrichment programs</a> and career guidance services provide additional support.
    <br><br>These criteria were used in promoting learners from one grade level to another to ensure their successful completion of the Senior High School program.
