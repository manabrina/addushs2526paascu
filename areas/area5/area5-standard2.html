  <h3 class="criterion" id="criterion-1">Criterion 1. There is a plan to provide student services and support and a student monitoring system.</h3>
  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.0</p>
  <p>
    The school has a comprehensive plan to deliver student services to address learners’ academic and non-academic needs. At the start of each academic year, institutional planning and evaluation activities are conducted by service offices to anticipate student needs and enhance programs. This plan includes programs in guidance and counseling, health and wellness, transportation, food services, campus ministry, and student formation activities. These plans are regularly reviewed and updated to stay responsive to the evolving needs of students.
    <br><br>A student monitoring system complements the plan through individual inventory records, counseling logs, academic and attendance tracking, referrals, and student satisfaction surveys. These tools provide data for timely interventions and improvements. Results are consolidated and discussed by the administrators, ensuring that services remain relevant, accessible, and effective in supporting holistic student formation.

  <h3 class="criterion" id="criterion-2">Criterion 2. The school has well-defined, adequate, and accessible programs for student services to support learners’ academic and non-academic needs.</h3>
  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.5</p>
  <p>
    The school provides well-defined, adequate, and accessible student services that holistically support learners’ academic and non-academic needs while fostering a safe and nurturing environment.
    <br><br>Academic support is offered through admission assistance, financial aid programs such as the Top 500 Scholarship and Grant-in-Aid, and transition activities like the Ateneo Senior High Orientation Program (A-SHOP). The Learner Needing Intervention (LNI) and Senior High Unified Monitoring (SUM) systems coordinate with teachers, advisers, and parents to address academic concerns, while strand-based programs, competitions, and vertical alignment initiatives such as the College Open House and Diagnostic Test further enrich learning. Student well-being is safeguarded through functional committees on child protection, anti-bullying, and discipline, and supported by administrative offices such as the Physical Plant, Finance, Food Court, and Human Resources. Beyond academics, student life is enriched through Eucharistic celebrations, retreats, wellness and sports programs, arts and culture, clubs and organizations, and school-wide activities. These initiatives collectively nurture academic growth, personal development, and social responsibility.

  <h3 class="criterion" id="criterion-4">Criterion 4. Measures are regularly undertaken to review the effectiveness of the programs for student services and support and student monitoring systems.</h3>
  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3.9</p>
  <p>
    The school regularly reviews the effectiveness of student services, support programs, and monitoring systems to ensure they remain responsive, consistent, and aligned with learner needs. These reviews—conducted through evaluations, feedback tools, and post-event assessments—help identify strengths, address gaps, and guide continuous improvement. The Admissions and Aid Office evaluates admissions, enrollment, scholarships, and orientation programs, while administrative offices use feedback to enhance services. The Formation Office assesses chaplaincy, retreats, wellness, student activities, and clubs, with the Student Government’s Students’ Rights and Concerns Committee (SRC) gathering student concerns for administrative action. Major events undergo post-evaluations, and student clubs are reviewed for leadership effectiveness. Academically, cluster meetings, the LNI and SUM systems, and tools like the Educator’s Journal provide data for timely interventions and policy enhancements. These systematic and regular reviews ensure services are evidence-based, effective, and continuously improved to support holistic student formation.

  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3.5</p>
  <p>
    The school continuously improves its student services and monitoring systems to remain responsive to the needs and expectations of learners and stakeholders.
    <br><br>Scheduled evaluation meetings, feedback tools, and monitoring reports inform program refinements and new initiatives. The LNI and SUM systems are updated to address academic and behavioral concerns more effectively, with the recent inclusion of a Level 4 mechanism to provide additional support for at-risk students. To meet emerging interests, the school also opens opportunities for new clubs and organizations each semester, allowing learners to pursue varied passions, interests, and leadership opportunities. These ongoing enhancements ensure that AdDU-SHS services remain relevant, adaptive, and student-centered.
