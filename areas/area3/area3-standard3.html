The school has an adequate number of classrooms; it maintains eight (8) unutilized classrooms that are ready for occupancy when needed. As the primary centers of learning, each is equipped with an LCD projector, LED TV, tables and chairs, whiteboards, and full air-conditioning.
    <br><br>Significant among the facilities are the library with its audio-visual room and collaboration rooms, the science laboratories, one each for Physics, Biology, Chemistry, Computer, and Technical Drawing Room, which have provided learners with hands-on learning experiences. Adequate laboratory space, safety features, and modern apparatus ensure effective instruction, encourage experimentation, and promote collaborative learning. The school has set aside provisions for additional science laboratories in the near future.
    <br><br>The large gymnasium and the Olympic-size swimming pool support and enhance the physical education and sports programs of the school. The gymnasium is also available as a venue for symposia on social issues and preparations for the community service activities, such as gathering and packing of relief goods.
    <br><br>The Christ the King Chapel, prominently located at the center of the campus, provides a spiritual anchor to the school’s physical layout and reflects the institution’s commitment to holistic development. Its program includes a monthly Mass that is open to the public, especially to the residents of the Bangkal community.
    <br><br>The presence of these major facilities demonstrates the school’s commitment to providing a conducive and well-rounded learning environment.
