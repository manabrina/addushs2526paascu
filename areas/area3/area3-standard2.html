  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.8</p>
  <p>
    Ateneo de Davao University’s financial management system is remarkably effective due to its exceptional alignment with the university’s vision, mission, and goals. The university makes sure that the existing financial management system is designed to efficiently allocate limited resources to support teaching, research, and community service initiatives, making sure that the funds are directed where they are needed the most.
    <br><br>Through the effective financial management system, the institution can perform a consistent balancing act between revenue and expenditures, especially during the pandemic when cash inflow was very challenging. This helps decide how much is allocated to the different programs and priorities making sure the financial stability of the university is maintained vis-a-vis the attainment of Mission-Vision.
    <br><br>Furthermore, the University budget system ensures support for the attainment of the school’s programs and activities.

  <p>
    The University adopts a participative budgeting process, which includes regular review and analysis of the budget performance reports. While the Finance Office plays an integral role in the development of the University’s annual budget, every school of the academic community plays an active role and responsibility in the budgeting process by submitting annual budget proposals.

  <p>
    The University’s overall accounting internal control is highly effective in safeguarding university assets, maintaining the integrity of financial records, and ensuring compliance with all relevant regulatory requirements.
    <br><br>This is achieved, primarily, by the Vice President for Finance and Treasurer, who sets the tone in establishing a strong control environment and is key in advocating commitment to integrity at all levels of the university. Moreover, the systems and procedures in place help ensure that the established internal controls are effective which include clear segregation of duties throughout the accounting process, rigorous transaction review and approval process, regular reconciliation of accounts and monitoring, proper documentation and record-keeping, implementation of regular job rotation among personnel involved in the accounting, and stringent authorization and access controls for critical financial data and systems. In fact, strong dedication to internal control effectiveness is affirmed by the audit opinion from an external auditor, which consistently highlights the absence of any material deficiencies or significant weaknesses within the internal control system. This attestation from a credible third party underscores the robustness of the internal control. Lastly, the finance team comprises highly skilled and competent personnel who are instrumental in enforcing effective internal control.

  <p>
    The school annually carries out internal and external audits. The internal audit is done through the internal auditor, and externally through SGV.
    <br><br>The Internal Pre-Audit procedures play a crucial role in validating the reliability of accounting systems and reports. The presence of pre-audit helps detect and prevent deficiencies and other irregularities within the financial process. This proactive measure not only mitigates potential issues but also highlights the accuracy, relevance, and completeness of financial reporting. By bolstering Pre-Internal Audit mechanisms, we ensure that the stakeholders receive accurate and timely information, particularly crucial during challenging times like the pandemic, enabling them to make well-informed decisions.
    <br><br>To balance the audit, an external audit is done through SGV, and the institution undergoes rigorous scrutiny by the Davao Extension Office (DEO) of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), reinforcing the thorough monitoring and compliance measures in place. This external evaluation by a government agency attests to the integrity of the financial statements. Lastly, the possession of the PCNC Certificate of Accreditation serves as a tangible testament to the firm's adherence to principles of good governance, transparency, and accountability.

    Specific departments are dedicated to routine maintenance of the assets to guarantee their optimal performance, like the specific units for laboratory equipment and other movable equipment, the University Information and Technology Office (UITO) for IT equipment, and the Physical Plant Office (PPO) for other non-IT equipment. Furthermore, regular asset count and tagging procedures were also being conducted to further reinforce accountability.
    <br><br>Moreover, regular property appraisals are being conducted by a credible third party, which helps us provide accurate and updated valuations of assets, enabling our financial planning and budgeting. Lastly, our asset disposal process adheres to a defined process that includes proper documentation, competitive bidding, and necessary approvals. All this collective effort is to ensure the responsible asset management of the university, which contributes to its overall financial stability.

    It is the University’s financial policy to strategically allocate surplus funds to maximize returns, in accordance with risk tolerance. Idle funds are invested in short-term time deposit accounts and treasury bonds to yield a decent return for use in the operation of the school.
    <br><br>Investment of excess funds diversifies the investment portfolio while ensuring that the liquidity position is not affected. These investments are carefully selected and monitored by our Vice President for Finance and Treasurer, and the Accounting Manager.

    The University maintains comprehensive insurance coverage with an accredited insurance provider to safeguard its key facilities, equipment, and other high-value assets. This coverage ensures financial protection against potential risks such as fire, natural disasters, theft, and other unforeseen events. By securing these assets, the University is able to protect its investments, maintain operational continuity, and minimize financial losses in the event of damage or disruption.
    <br><br>In addition, the Finance Office regularly reviews the insurance policies to confirm that coverage remains adequate and up-to-date with the current valuation of assets and emerging risk exposures. This proactive measure reflects the University’s commitment to prudent fiscal management, risk mitigation, and the protection of institutional resources.
